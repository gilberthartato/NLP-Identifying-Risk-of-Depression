doqwow,SQLwitch,2364,177.0,1572360722,depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here."

My wife and daughters recently went out of town to visit family and I was unable to go due to work. After just a couple days I came to a really grim realization. I have no friends. None, zero, nada. I went through my last three months of calls and it goes like this... Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, grandma, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, work, wife, wife, wife, wife. 
Without my family, I have nobody. Everything I do I do completely alone or with my family. This never really bothered me before but I find myself envying people around me who are making plans, going to fun events and overall just loving life. My wife has friends. A whole community of other moms that she goes out with multiple times a week while I... Sit at home. I don't even know how to make friends!

After couples therapy this morning all I could do is scream and now I can’t stop laughing at how pointless everything in life is. I’m crying and laughing at the same time and can’t stop and don’t really give a shit.

I’ve experienced every type of abuse that exists at the hands of my parents. Completely no contact with my entire family. Absolutely no friends. Struggling to keep ahold of my job and meet deadlines. Diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety, depression, Autism, and ADHD so far but there’s probably more. The only person in this world I can trust wants to trial separate and/or divorce.

I’m just so fucking done. I don’t care anymore. I’ve spent my entire life gaslighting myself, telling myself I’m just unlucky with humans and things will get better. But it never does. Others keep telling me that too. “Hold out hope! You aren’t destined for unhappiness! I just want you happy!” But it’s all just a bunch of bullshit. The people who are supposed to love me the most in this world royally fucked me up and I’ve spent my 30 years on this planet desperately trying to unfuck my brain but nothing works. I’ve been in 3 different types of therapy a week for almost a year now and have done several different types of therapy for the last decade+. I have tried so, so fucking hard and put 110% in but it’s just not working. I can’t do it anymore.

And now my husband is sick of me because my mental health just brings him down. He feels like the relationship isn’t 50/50. He wants kids and I can barely take care of myself. He keeps telling me “I just want us both happy.” I wish him all the best, but I’ve realized happiness just isn’t in the cards for me. I really hope he finds it. But now he’s just like everyone else. Everyone hurts me and leaves, or forces me to leave because of the abuse.

This probably sounds like a mopey sob story of “woe is me” and I just don’t really care. I don’t even know why I am putting this out in the universe. 

I wish I could just disappear. Or get hit by a bus. Or drown in my bathtub. Life is fucking awful. I’m done."

1bkk512,Lunetrivian,6,4.0,1711061733,depression,"My therapist made me feel so bad I am still mad about it Sorry this is kinda long, I just need to say this somewhere. 

It has been months since I attempted to go to 
a work healthcare therapist, overall it's been years since I wanted to go to therapy at all. 
I have a long history with mental health problems, long term depression and major anxiety disorder are the biggest things I suppose, I've worked through so many things and my life has changed so much for the better over the years. 
But I do have issues with self esteem that I just seem to never be able to get over. It's starting to affect my life again and I really want to not feel so shitty about myself all the time. 

So this recent thing just won't stop coming back to me. I hate it, and it makes me feel like I was stupid for trying to get back to therapy. So I just need to let it out somewhere since I keep these things a secret from pretty much everyone irl.

I had a couple of sessions, mostly because my anxiety and self hatred got so bad I started to have panic attacks at work. The first couple of times were fine, basic things u know. Thought exercises and going through stuff that I can try to get over my negative self talk. 

But the last time I saw the therapist just kinda broke me. 

So I have this thing where if I get too many work hours I completely begin to fall apart, I'm talking normal people hours are too much for me. I work in retail so sometimes I have double the work hours in a week. 
The session was on my one day off in the middle of the week and I was already shaking and crying when I got there because I was so stressed, tired and anxious. I cry easily, I can have 5 panic attacks a day on bad times, so this was not a good time for me. I hoped it would make me feel a little better to talk about it so I still went. 

She did not know what to say to me. It was awkward as hell sitting there in silence when she just stared at me and asked If I was going to keep crying. She asked questions to get my mind off of things I suppose but the thing is. I cry so hard if I think about good things while panicking because it makes me feel guilty, 

I told her that, but she wanted me to talk about stuff I did with my friends that week. I had a bit of a breakdown then and there. I kept shaking and bouncing my legs while crying hysterically. I said I was sorry to be like that instead of getting the proper words out, and I tried to calm myself down with breathing exercises. 

She just stared at me. She looked so offended that I was even there. 
Then after I got myself to calm down I said some stupid joke about it all and laughed a bit. she just stared at me and sighed in frustration. “I don't get what is there for you to cry about, we were talking about good things.” Then she just stared at me, like I was stupid or something. 

I just said that sorry, I feel like I don't deserve good things and it just overwhelmed me. 

She scoffed at that. Then said “Honestly I don't understand what you want me to say to you anymore, you should have stayed home today.” 

I don't even remember much after that. I thanked her for the previous sessions and left. I stared at my walls for the rest of that day. 

It's been months but I can't stop thinking about that moment. I quit my meds too and I really should go see a doctor again but I can't bring myself to schedule a time. I feel so humiliated. I feel disgusted by myself for wasting anyone's time. Now I want to hide my problems again and that makes me feel so mad at everything since I haven't felt this bad in a while. Was I really so wrong for wanting therapy again? I feel so humiliated.

I said something and it just didn’t get a reaction or it was like i didn’t even say anything. And so i went quiet, and my best mate the one im closest to from them all turned around on the way to the other place for food and asked if i wanted left home on the way through because i was “quiet”. 

And today has just made me re evaluate what i do around them and how i act. Feels like i have to pretend to be someone else sometimes. 

Doesn’t help that before they thought i didn’t like them because sometimes i go quiet or don’t act the way i do with my really close mates (2 of them out of the friend group)  like i do with them.

I'm cool with people when they don't enter my life, but attempts to get close to me are the worst, even if to offer me help, when I least realize I'm saying something like shut up, leave me alone, go away, don't touch me. I'm complaining more about everything and responding aggressively to loud noises or sudden movements near me. Honestly I feel like an animal. It's terrible because I want to be good, bring good things to people's lives and have meaningful relationships and be vulnerable with someone, but the anger is always stronger. 

Sure I feel remorse, but it's not enough for me to change. I've isolated myself, no one deserves to deal with my instability. 

And of course depression gets worse. This damned disease is like a boss who constantly summons side creatures that help and feed it during the battle.

1bkhqh4,Rikkely,5,2.0,1711055821,depression,"Depression as a defense mechanism against something worse? Hi!

Been depressed since I was in first grade, maybe even kindergarten if that's possible.

The last 5 years has been a battle (all the years have been really). It was when my first child was born that I realized something was wrong. To be in pain and doing everything I can to avoid it in every waking hour had worked ok minus up until then. Averaging a year, I could be performing ok for 8 months, I can do this, I just have to push through. No serene calm moments, only trying to escape.  


During these last 5 years I have tried to keep calm. Accept the hurt, not fighting, sit there and take it. God damn it hurts. Now I am here. After all those minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, not getting ANY better. Counting the the number of times psychologists have nodded their head at me would be like counting the stars in the beautiful midnight sky. I think I know the reason for this depression though. A difficult childhood with no huge traumas, but just a general feeling of not ever being safe or even being taken care of and a huge dose of everything feeling like a big pile of sh... or chaos. I was always on watch for threats for some reason, and have been always.  


The child that was happy, eager, looking forward to every day with a huge amount of energy suddenly became this calm, controlled and quiet shell of itself. I have been searching for answers for so long and I think I may be on to something??? This is where I need your input.

Google can be your friend I have heard. Maybe less now than before, but the search ""Depression the body's way to protect itself"" gave some insightful hits. (For me this is a new train of thought, I never saw depression as a symptom, just the illness itself)  


This article ""[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shouldstorm/202012/we-ve-got-depression-all-wrong-it-s-trying-save-us)"" describes something that I feel in my core. I recently experienced anxiety like never before after I got really ill from a virus that just teared me down like nothing else. My two kids, who have not turned 6 yet had to go a whole day with a packet of crackers. I was unable to take care of them. This is also were my defenses, my depression and my flight responses had to bow, my brain did no longer have the energy to ""use"" depression as a defense mechanism. 

What happens when the defense is gone? The real threat appears. The one that has been hidden for almost 30 fucking years! The anxiety. This feeling of terror and nothingness. The feeling that the whole existence is in danger, my kids, my fiancée, my life, my efforts, everything in my life was just not important, existence was this fleeting feeling of vulnerability and even not existing at all. Everything felt as it could disappear in a second. Nothing lasts more than a second in the universes' time scale.  


**So sorry for the looong f' read. I just hope someone can offer their thoughts on this subject. Can depression be a defense mechanism against something far worse?** Something that really disables the body from doing any action? I swear, when my body was immobilized by this anxiety I could do nothing, not anything at all. With depression I can hurt and hurt and hurt and have moments of strength were I can cook, mow the lawn and other small tasks, if even for just an hour of a week. I have been through pills and alcohol - nothing works as you know, it's just trying to cope, whatever it takes.  


Thank you for reading and good luck in your endeavors, whether you can help me or not. I really hope we can get better, all of us."

1bk6tyy,scaredycat07,20,8.0,1711028588,depression,"I want someone to hurt me I (26F) have been getting these intense urges of wanting someone to hurt me. I want someone to pin me to the ground, hold my wrists next to my head so I can’t move. I often have fantasies of a man doing this to me, punching me and cutting me while he laughs, and I struggle. Lately I’ve been picturing a specific fictional character doing this to me. 

I get an adrenaline rush from these daydreams, and often feel a lot happier. They bring me comfort. And this isn’t in anyway sexual. I just want someone to beat me up. 

Since a young age, I’ve read fanfiction and role plays that involve these things happening to the reader. I would get that same adrenaline rush. 

I also have some self-destructive thoughts, but these daydreams are more intense. 

I was sexually abused as a kid, but it could have been way worse. And I was probably emotionally abused too. But I was never hit or punched or anything like that as a kid. 

I know these thoughts aren’t normal, but I don’t want to lose them either. I don’t engage in anything like that in real life.

1bkkjaz,PrestigiousBus2664,3,2.0,1711062738,depression,"My Journey so far… I wrote this as a comment to another post, but felt maybe my journey is worth sharing on its own. 

I’ve fought depression and intrusive thoughts my entire life (33m). I’ve always been chunkier than my friends, even when I’m in decent fit shape I look chunky if you see me with clothes on. I struggle with social anxiety and anxiety in general, I never feel fully confident in myself and I struggle with meeting new people.  I’ve always felt inadequate, even when the world tells me I’m good, and I’ve had this “why me?” victim mentality for years. 

Last year, I got out of a relationship with someone I assumed to be my life partner after 11 years. It wasn’t because of my issues, she was always supportive of that, but it fucking destroyed me and put me in the lowest low of my life. It motivated me to get real help, and find the best me. Learning to recognise my triggers through professional help was my first big step. It took me 3 different therapists to find one that I clicked with.

For me any form of social media binging is my biggest trigger, to the point that I now put a timer on for like 45mins or something to stop me falling into an episode.  I’ll then switch it up to do some chores, read a book or go for a walk etc.

I make sure to try and stay socially engaged with my friends, even when I don’t feel like it. I’ve always hated “alone time” until I started working hard on it recently.

I’ve learned what “self care” means to me. I love to mountain bike personally (even though sometimes I resent going, that’s normal), so I started building myself a self care routine around that. I’ll go out and interact with the world to get a coffee etc, go for my ride, go for a sandwich at my favourite deli and then have some downtime. Then I’ll reassess what I feel motivated to do that evening.

I’m learning that I have amazing qualities to my personality, and that I’m a beautiful person in my own way. I’m not perfect, but who is? People who portray themselves as “rock solid” and show no vulnerability are the ones with the biggest insecurities.  The most toxic trait of depression is comparing yourself to others who are “doing great”. I’ve started thinking “fuck them, I’m on my journey”. They all have issues and are probably thinking I have no issues.

I’m learning to communicate much more clearly, and that I can just say ‘no’ without a BS excuse when I don’t want to do something. I’m learning that me doing a favour/gesture for someone doesn’t mean they have to return it. I’m seeing that putting myself out there should be done from a place of love, not to get something in return. 

I’m 100% still a WIP, and I still have days where I can’t even do life, but the changes I’ve felt in the last few months are unlike anything ever felt in my entire adult life. The world looks like a much better place, I’m feeling more confident in my own unique self and I’m looking forward to the rest of the journey ahead of me.

 I’ve even noticed how my own happiness draws people to me, friends and dates. People actually enjoy being around me when I’m my true self, that means a lot to me. 

This isn’t a “look at me, I’m fucking amazing” post. I hope someone else out there can gain something from my journey, never give up on yourself!!"

I love my mom, I’m just so sick of the fights that are always my fault bc of some attitude. I think it’s just me expressing any emotion that she disagrees with at the time but if I can figure out how to mask up, maybe I’ll figure out if I’m right.

I'm 27 now, pregnant, and engaged to the absolute love of my life. Life isn't perfect, mostly regarding our finances, but we're okay.

When we found out about my pregnancy, I was already 4 months in. We were over the moon. I was so happy, I'm still happy... I love my daughter more than life.

Anyway, I'm terrified, I don't think I'll be a good mom. I think of ending it all daily, I can't act on anything because I could never do anything to hurt her. I can't leave my partner by himself, I couldn't hurt him like that. He's damn near killing himself with work to make sure our daughter and I are taken care of. I'm so fucking guilty.

I feel alone, I'm ashamed, and I'm so mad at myself for not being able to just be happy. I can't leave the house, because I'm on bed rest. I don't have friends to run to, I didn't have a baby shower, barely anyone knows. 

Someone asked me ""is there anything I can do for you right now?"" at the clinic the other day and I just broke down.

I don't know, I'm rambling. I need advice. It's supposed to get better, I thought I was better. I just want to be better for my partner and daughter. They don't deserve a defective piece of shit like me."

Happy. Sad. Happy. Sad. I genuinely do not want to try to get better at this point because that takes time and effort and I suck at everything. If it doesn't fix itself, I'm gonna solve the problem. Tired of little things ruining my mood. I didn't ask for a brain this fucking complicated.

Ya wanna know another fucked up thing? I almost hate that everyone's attitude has changed when it comes to mental health. Like logically, I know it's better. I know it's beneficial and I want EVERYONE ELSE to be happy. The problem is, I finally adapted to the more negative society. I had it. And then, everyone flipped it. ""True strength is vulnerability"" and all that shit. It hits hard. Feels like a fucking attack on my fucking person. 

Also, lets get real for a second. NO ONE likes me. Nope. No one at all. I'm an undesirable race, an undesirable gender, and I hide all this negativity underneath. People like me get shit on all the time for struggling. They let us know just how much they don't like us. As for the other two, I realize that I will pay for the sins of my forefathers as well as the sins of my peers. When people look at me when I'm out, they don't see me. No. They probably just see some opportunistic criminal. Doesn't help that I picked up a lot of slang words.

But maybe I deserve it. I'm not a good person. I'm really not. I've had thoughts that I shouldn't have. I've done things that I shouldn't have. Sometimes, I silently sympathize with the evil. I'm not a good person. I'm just valueless trash. Part of me wants to stop trying. To prove everyone right. To justify every stereotype and fear.

I feel like I suffer from Depression (MDD) and suicidality. It's been 10+ years like this with ebbs and flows here and there but it's gotten worse imo the past 5+ months. 

I feel deep down that I don't have it in me to get better 😢 like, I don't feel deep down that I have the strength physically, emotionally and mentally.

For the past few months I think I tried to take solace in the idea and thought that hopefully therapy will help. At least hope for it. But then recently I really started having thoughts & feelings of...what's the point? 💔 no matter what or who you go to...it seems like at the end of the day it's really up to you to make that difference. But I don't feel like I have it in me to get better. And, that's made me feel more depressed imo. Like, as sad as it sounds I had this thought of that...it's cheaper to just...not be, instead of suffering through it and trying to get out of abuse for example. 

I was lucky enough to recieve a therapy call session recently and the although the lady therapist was really sharp & professional and lovely - she was also imo really blunt with me and stated very bluntly that ""you have to fight for your life"". But again...what if I don't have it in me anymore? Again I am very grateful for the call session but feel sad deep down about all this.

Whatever it is that's missing feels deeper than just drive and motivation. I don't know what it is though but everyone seems to have it and I don't feel it in me anymore...

It doesn't help that I live in an abusive situation that I cannot get out of. 

I sincerely don't know what to do 😢.."
1bkpzm2,DetectivePrince_,1,0.0,1711078637,depression,"my happiness is impossible without the happiness of my parents, it was hypocritical to try to find happiness. I feel like a complete freak My parents say I just need sex with a woman. I don’t know. I feel like shit.

I (AMAB20) have experienced feelings of dysphoria since I was about 12 years old, I dreamed of being a girl, wished about it before going to bed, played as female characters, used things to make it seem like I had breasts. I'm not a good masturbator, and I can only feel some kind of arousal if I imagine myself as a girl. I thought it was just a fetish, but by the time I was 18 I was thinking about it literally several times a day.

Recently, the feeling of anxiety has increased greatly, I often have panic attacks, I get very irritated sometimes, I often hurt myself (hitting my head against the wall, biting and cutting my hands). I turned to a doctor for help, after 4 months I received medication. They helped for a while, but they quietly increased my feelings of dysphoria, somehow unbeknownst to me, I began to explore the possibility of becoming trans, looked at other people, and this awakened certain feelings in me. Now it has become difficult for me to think about anything else, I began to sleep poorly (4 hours a day), eat poorly (lost weight from 83 kg to 73 kg), and yesterday I had my first major panic attack after taking medication. I couldn’t stand it, I called the doctor, they admitted me, and there I told him with great difficulty (in fact, I wrote and showed the text, because it was very hard for me to talk about it) about my desires. The doctor prescribed therapy.

Nevertheless, it was hard for me, I have no friends, good acquaintances, and I only communicate with my parents. I decided to ease my mind a little (without mentioning the last visit to the doctor), talked about therapy and my feelings of anxiety, said that if they knew the truth about me, they would disown me. They thought I was gay and asked if I felt attracted to women, well, yes, I do, just not in the way they thought. After that, they said that all the problems were due to the fact that I didn’t have sex, and after sex I would relax and stop worrying.

They promised to find me a girl, and I felt like complete crap because I couldn't tell them the whole truth. Sometimes I regret so much that I was born at all, lately I dream of falling asleep and never waking up (I'm too cowardly to kill myself, if I had the courage, I would have done it long ago, it would have only saved everyone people from my problems, anyway my life doesn’t have much meaning, no one will worry if I die, especially if I write in a note about my feelings, everyone will even be happy). 

They also asked to share with them their next visit to the therapist. So I decided that I would tell the therapist that my thoughts were just delusions, a momentary clouding, and I would feel better and would refuse therapy. It was very hypocritical to think that I could find happiness through therapy, but this happiness is impossible without the happiness of my parents. So I decided to just suppress all these feelings. I don’t know why I’m writing this, I just need to express myself somewhere.

I didn't mind it one bit. I cried twice texting him. He got sm info out of me mannn. 

I told him about my 'mommy issues' which before I didn't realize until I started talking about it and realized that 'mommy issues' isnt having your mom run away, or physical abuse, and it isn't always black and white with the term 'mommy issues'. Later I'll deny my issues but I know right now what's good for me.

I told him I felt recognized and that he made me cry twice happily.   
He told me that when I was talking about a previous best friend of mine I sounded lonely and sad about it, and that my story was really saddening.

She’ll tell us how she’s a slave in this house (literally for taking care of us like a mother should) and call us names. She’s called us retards, she hit me on the head (I was pissed and trying to sleep and my siblings were making noises, I thought my brother entered my room so I turned and said shut the fuck up, turns out it was my mom and she ran at me while screaming and kept slapping my head) she’s tried to push me off a chair when I refused to defend my aunt who is a terrible person. She’s is constantly stressed out, it feels like she makes everything about her and I know that she’s just struggling but I can’t deal with it. The thing that angered me off the most was when I went to the hospital (mental health issues) and while I could tell there was genuine concern for me and she wanted me to get better, I can’t say I enjoyed how that entire year and even still now she makes it about her. She’ll tell me how much it affected her and talk about how much money she spent on me. I know this is all a lot and I do wanna say that I love her and she does a lot for me but how am I supposed to deal with someone like this? Help?"

I’ve never had a boyfriend or any kind of connection with anyone, which makes me feel like a complete freak and even more lonely. It seems like everyone I’ve talked to has had at least one partner. I feel so behind in life. I’m a virgin, I’ve never even kissed a boy. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I crave a relationship and connection, but at the same time I don’t. I don’t know how to explain it. Sometimes I’ll desperately want someone so I’ll download a dating app, but then when it comes to it I don’t ever meet anyone I want to go on a date with or be with. I don’t understand how I feel. But it’s been making me very depressed. I’ve struggled with depression for many years but it seems to be getting worse as I get older. I always thought things would change naturally and I’d make more friends and find a partner, but I never have. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s getting to the point now where I feel like life just isn’t for me. I just don’t want to be alone anymore. Why can’t I find someone? I don’t understand my own feelings. I don’t understand why I so badly want a relationship but at the same time I don’t. Everyone pressures me into finding someone but I can’t.

1bkoxma,rockymt28,1,0.0,1711075309,depression,"Abilify was helping more than the antidepressant. I recently got off Abilify and it has been a rollercoaster…I’ve been extremely depressed, mood swings, and suicidal. Now I can’t sleep. No appetite, haven’t been eating for more than once a day. Not sure if this is all withdrawal symptoms I’m on week 3-4.

However, my mom mentioned when I started it I did become less depressed and stable. I got it prescribed for my anger outburst not depression. I have realized that antidepressants actually never helped me at all. I’m on Wellbutrin now and I have been for a while. Not until I started Abilify is when I became neutral and could handle life a bit better. Now that I’m off it ….I’m back to square one. It seems like it was helping my depression and irritability..as well as motivation. 

But I do not want to get back on the medicine as I heard the effects of it slowing down your brain basically making you dumber in simpler words over time. And all the withdrawal effects I never want to experience it again..even though I’m not positive if it’s only withdrawal or I’m back to how I was when I was only on an antidepressant…

Is it possible that Abilify helped my depression more than the antidepressant? 
As well as I don’t think I’m bipolar because I have never experienced mania. I experience mood swings often but it’s more like depressed>neutral> hopeful>angry>depressed again repeat . I’m not too angry right now as I used to have anger outbursts before I started Abilify 2 years ago. But I never been diagnosed as bipolar since I’m mostly fatigued, no motivation, and depressed all the time! 

Another question is, does anyone know of a medicine that works similar to Abilify???? Balances the domphaine level? Honestly maybe that’s what helps with my mood and depression. 


I do have adhd as well and I’m taking adderall but it doesn’t really help anymore I’m going to ask to try vyanese as I heard it helps people a lot even with depression? "
1bkbdfc,queensnking,6,2.0,1711040273,depression,"I am doing much better in life and have improved a lot. Yet, I just know I am going to end up committing suicide someday. I'm (24M) tired. Just tired. I have spent my whole life on my own and severely depressed. My first attempt was at 14, and I can't even tell how many have been since then. I know I am not doing that bad in life -- I am halfway through my phd at 24, I made it to NYC; and I love this city. I don't actively try to kill myself anymore, but it's a constant passive thought. It's always a possibility.

I bought two ropes a couple of months ago. One is in my bedroom, the other one I carry with me in my backpack every single day, because, I mean, ""just in case."" I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in life and will never be who I want to be. I've always hated who I am, and people disgust me. I have been fantasizing about my death for ages now. I want to make it epic. If I make it big, at least I'll have accomplished something by the end — dying will be my happiest and most glorious moment. I have several suicidal notes already, I have several plans too. I want to make it public, I want to hang myself somewhere. I know the best spots in most bridges in this city already. I just want to feel something.

I'm surprised I've made it to 24. I have been thinking about dying for so long that I have never pictured myself far into the future. If I were to tell my 15 yo self right now that I'd be alive at 24, I'd just laugh. I know I am not killing myself today. But I know it will just happen at some moment. And it won't take long."
1bkk1l4,TranquilScrimmage,2,0.0,1711061486,depression,"I wish that I could kill myself but something won’t let me.. (23M) For the past 4 years, I have been going strong on a losing streak. Since 2020, I’ve striving to achieve ANYTHING!! Graduating university, losing weight and being attractive, be consistent in my artwork/Youtube, revive my athletic career, build some savings and maybe finally start dating again lol. However, I’m failing everyone and it’s ALL my fault. 

Here’s the thing, on paper…I’m doing everything right. 
* I have a decent job in my home town that fits in my psychology field.
* For the past 3 years… I was about 330lbs, as of my I’m back in the 200s at 280lbs. Even though I’ll probably ruin my progress soon. 
* After being dismissed and fucked over a few years back, I’m about 3 semesters (not counting summer classes) from graduating with a bachelors. Doing…better academically??

Not even trying to be self-deprecating but…I’m a pussy. All of my bullies were right! I can’t finish anything that I started and was properly estimated. Sure, I have friends! Friends that I love to death. Although, the things that we love …don’t always love you back or the same way. There hobbies and outlets for me, but I CAN’T take my foot off the gas now.
* If I don’t receive a B average by this semester end, I’ll get dismissed again! Not to mention, I probably just failed one of my midterms. 
* My stepfather is retiring soon so my mom and I are going to have a rougher time helping pay for school. 
* A good chunk of my friends are graduating soon and I’ll be here by myself. 
* Therapy hasn’t really helped me either. They want me on meds but I don’t want to live my life relying on that stuff. 

I just can’t stop myself. Let me be completely honest with all of you, there are times where I just want to end myself! (I wrote my second suicide note last night). If things won’t change if stop trying, then why tf haven’t they? Trying is the reason why I’m here in this hellhole alone. It’s like there’s two people in my mind. One of them yells:

“Why are you STILL trying?!”
“Why do keep on letting yourself and others down?” 
“Are you trying to prove everyone that said that you’re a soft, mediocre, pathetic and ugly waste of sperm correct?” 
“You’re 23! Being a shy, awkward dork has NEVER been cute. Nobody wants that.”

Every time before that voice finally pushes me to swallow those pills or  buy that gun…the other voice makes a comeback. My spirit still wants me to prove others wrong and is determined to make something of myself! My spirit wants to give every obstacle and non-believer the middle finger and tell them to “STFU!!l” Someone that’s loved, has pride to their name and that’s an overall decent person that didn’t sell their soul. 

Sorry for this is being SOOO long. I don’t blame you for not reading any of it. I just needed to get that all out of me! Wish me luck on this amateur strongman competition this Saturday. Even though I won’t win, I hope that I push myself to the point of heart attack.

I'm not gonna say every problem that I've had to solve, but it could be nice if anyone wouldn't make me feel bad that I just wanted a better life where I wasn't abused and traumatised. Plus I don't even know what to say because I was never allowed to express myself.

I had to move to a different country by myself because the people there were too homophobic and racist and aggressive The very same were my own family and old friends. I'm queer, I couldn't stand their racism and how unfair it was that they still abused me even tho I was just minding my own business. Once I moved out to a different country, I was homeless for like two months, then I got into an governmental accommodation for young homeless adults, but the people in that dorm are just drug addicts and convicts that are over 4 years older than me, and I have to share a dorm room with two of them. One of them is also from the country I left, and he's been bullying me just because I'm quiet, the same like the ones I had to deal with in highschool. Four months passed since I had to live with the morons and it's just terrifying because I never know when they'd just try to provoke me to a fight and they'd bully me. I told the managers of the accommodation, but they just gave the morons some warnings. I've tried to secure a job, but no luck since I'm just 18 and I don't have any experience. I just don't know how to manage to stay motivated anymore when it doesn't seem like anything will get better and I just have to endure more trauma. 

TL;DR: I've had a very traumatic time growing up. I moved to a different country by myself. It's not getting better and I don't know what to do.

1bknldm,Yucazet,1,1.0,1711071299,depression,"Hoy fue un día igual a los anteriores He estado internada un par de veces por intento de suicidio, y puedo decir que las personas encargadas dan de alta a pacientes que no siempre están estables del todo para salir, como yo. Me dieron de alta una vez, y años después me volvieron a internar, me dieron de alta por segunda vez, y después volví a intentarlo, hasta la última vez, que fui internada en un centro para mujeres con problemas de no sé qué tipo.
Pero ahí no ne dieron de alta, yo pedí que me sacaran porque era horrible estar ahi, una de las psicólogas insultaba de una manera horrible a una de mis compañera que tenía anorexia y bulimia, y le decía que estaba fea o que parecía un hueso o cosas por el estilo. En realidad nunca me gustó ese lugar y creo que mis padres se dieron cuenta de eso, por eso decidieron sacarme. No me enorgullezco por las veces que intenté suicidarme, se que le hice daño a mis padres y no me hace feliz ser consciente de eso, pero nunca tuve la intención de fallar a propósito para no morir en todas esas veces que lo intenté. Inclusive la última vez que lo intente, pensé que iba a ser la definitiva, que esa vez si iba a funcionar y que ya no iba a tener que lidiar con todo este asco y tristeza que siento por todo. Pero parece que tomarme 68 pastillas de las que encontré en el botiquín de la casa no fueron suficientes para terminar con mi vida.
Quizás si me hubiera tomado 100 hubiera funcionado, pero ya no habían más pastillas. Recuerdo un día que terminé en un hospital pero esa vez, no fue por intento de suicidio, sino porque estaba tan triste que me tome una botella entera de vodka sin agua. Al parecer me chocó porque no recuerdo nada y al día siguiente terminé en un hospital (olvidé decir que los odio), sin saber porque estaba ahí. Me dijeron que estuve apunto de entrar en un coma etilico; pero no pasó. En fin, solo quería recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. Aún que eso no quite que me sienta igual o que lo quiera hacer de nuevo. Cuando lo hice por primera vez tenía 15 años, en ese entonces dure casi un año sin verme en ningún espejo, ni en mi cuarto, ni en la calle, ni en los reflejos de las botellas, cucharas o cosas así. Y creo que estaba menos ansiosa porque no me veía la cara, pero era terrible cuando accidentalmente me veía.
Automáticamente lloraba o me ponía muy triste y no quería hacer nada por el resto del día o quizás hacía las cosas pero casi sin ganas de nada, sin ganas de estar viva. El compararme con otras personas, especialmente chicas se hizo algo frecuente, no puedo dejar de sentirme inferior y fea cuando veo a otra chica, de la edad que sea y se vea como se vea.
En mi cabeza siempre soy yo la más fea. Nunca he tenido enamorado en persona. Y hubo un tiempo en  

el que me deprimí porque pensé que nunca nadie se iba a fijar en mí por tener la cara que tengo, pensaba que me iba a quedar sola toda mi vida a pesar de que, no diría sueño, pero, uno de mis anhelos en la vida es conocer a una persona que me ame tal y como soy y me vea como alguien bonita o suficiente para el. Pensar en que quizás tener algo bonito y sincero con alguien no está destinado para mí me da mucha tristeza y quizás un poco de celos por las personas que si pueden o si tienen la oportunidad de tener algo así. Ahora ya no pienso que sea imposible del todo, pero si poco probable quizás. Aún que mi mayor preocupación no es eso, sino seguir teniendo la cara que tengo y tener que levantarme todos los días igual tratando de aparentar que todo está bien conmigo, que no me pasa nada y que estoy bien cuando realmente estoy pensando en acabar con mi vida. Nunca entendí porque hay personas que me decían que era bonita sin preguntárselos jamás, o porque habían chicos que me lo decían, nunca entendí y no entiendo como puede haber personas así. A veces pienso que esas personas, que me dijeron en su momento que soy bonita o me dan cumplidos sin ninguna razón, solo lo hacen por pena o lástima hacia mí. Y no lo digo solo por personas de mi familia, sino por chicos del colegio, de la universidad o del trabajo. Nunca acepté salir con ninguno de los chicos que me propusieron salir, y no porque no me parecían lindos, muchos de ellos eran realmente muy guapos, pero creo que me da algo de miedo salir con un chico (pese a que me gustaría tener pareja en algún momento de mi vida). Siento que solo quieren jugar conmigo o que al final terminarán haciéndome daño o cambiándome por una más bonita. Creo que no quiero sentir más dolor del que yo misma me hago sentir cada día, eso sería demasiado. Nunca he tenido una amiga, bueno, en realidad tuve una de 6to de primaria pero ya no nos hablamos porque me cambié de colegio y tuve otra (creo) en 1ro de secundaria, pero tampoco nos hablamos por el mismo motivo. Yo he pasado por muchos colegios, mis padres, mi hermano y yo nos mudábamos constantemente y no recuerdo haber durado más de un año en algún colegio, a excepción del último en el que estuve que fue un colegio de mujeres, en el que dure los últimos 4 años de secundaria antes de entrar a la universidad, y en esos 4 años no hice ni una sola amiga, lo cual es bastante triste y ahora me arrepiento de no haberlo intentado en vez de estarme comparando con todas mis compañeras de salón. En fin, solo quería recordar todo esto y desahogarme un poco. Aún que eso no quite que me siento igual que antes. Pero creo que aún tengo la esperanza de que en algún momento las cosas mejoren para mí y poder vivir una vida normal y tranquila, sin preocupaciones por mi cara y sin tenerle miedo a los espejos. "

Ok, here it goes... So there's this guy, and he's so god damned perfect for me in every way, and we've been spending hours talking. He wants to be in a committed relationship, but I told him I need to get to know him better and for longer before l can commit fully to him. I have a lot of barriers I put up around my heart because of psst incidents. I'm just out of fear of being hurt again.  I honestly never wanted to have another relationship just from fear. Not that i didn't want one.  It's all I've ever wanted in life just to share my heart with someone and be loved back.  I have so much love in my heart to give. I mean, just wow! He's honestly so incredibly perfect, and I have butterflies just thinking about him. I feel like a kid in love again who's just found out his crush likes him back hehehe. I really like him a lot, and I'm on the verge of turning into love. This is crazy because I don't fall for people easily, but when i do, i fall hard. He was just so disarming to all my defenses in our chats. I've been hurt a lot in the past, and there are things about me that would turn most people away things that can't be fixed. I'm an incomplete person. But he doesn't care about those things! I couldn't believe it he's either desperate crazy a combination of both or genuine, which is terrifying. I honestly don't know how anyone could love me.  So the problem starts here,  I told him today that I need him to take some time to think. Think as long as he needs about what a committed relationship would mean and what he is accepting because honestly, he can do sooooooo much better than me. With his personality, he can have anyone he wanted! I just don't want us to progress further and develop deeper feelings for him to realize it's not what he wants, and he didn't fully understand what he signed up for. Causing my heart stomped on again, i can't take it. It will completely break me if i let that happen.  If he were to not choose me, i would be crushed sure it's going to hurt like hell. but not like I will be if we get more involved and i fall head over heals for this guy.  I truly and honestly just want him to be happy, whatever that means for us, but im not going to lie. Im really hoping he chooses me. I know that's selfish, but I think he is actually the one who can finally help me heal my heart, and i want to do anything I can for him, even if just for a smile. I have already decided that if he does choose me,  I will immediately commit to him on the spot, no questions asked. We will be dating if he chooses me. If he says no, though... well, I'll just have to accept that it will hurt like hell, but I'll be okay after a while. Please send me your love and support right now, and even though I don't believe in God, I won't turn away any prayers.  I mean, if you can, bring yourself to pray for a gay guy, that is. I know gay relationships are against most religious faiths, especially the Abrahamic ones.  Anyway, I'll stop rambling now. Thank you for reading this.

1bkn7j3,Cantaloupe_Grand,1,0.0,1711070156,depression,"Idk what to do with myself anymore, it hurts I've been depressed for like 8 or so months, and it's only gotten worse and worse. I try to solve the issue that is making me feel bad, and before I manage, something else piles on. It's only gotten more severe, I've only gotten less motivated with every day. My family is completely horrible, always judging, always body shaming me, saying I can reach out to them for help, but then create an environment where the last thing I would want to do is reach out. I have 1 close friend who is always there for me, but I feel like all I am is a burden to him. I started dating for 4 months and I thought things where looking better for me, but I was just a desperate fool unable to notice the abuse and neglect in the relationship, and didn't notice how unhealthy it was, and despite how self destructive it was, I still battle with feelings whether or not I love him or not. Some days I hate him for how horrible he's treated me, others I wish I got another chance to be with him. I keep spiralling, I keep losing motivation to do anything, I've been eating incredibly little, I stopped doing any exercise, I stopped talking to anyone other than the 1 friend and brushing of others that try to talk to me, cos I feel like none of them are sincere and genuine, and I hate myself for how pathetic I am, and for how jealous I am of everyone around me that is better than me at everything. The idea of just making the pain stop with a couple pills is both terrifying and enticing. I want the pain to stop, but I know I will inflict pain on my family and friends, but I simultaneously don't feel like any of them are genuine, so what does it matter if i die? They wont care anyway. I don't know what to do, I spend so many nights crying alone, either hating myself for being worthless, or crying over a relationship that never should have happened, or crying while my mind is completely numb. I don't know what to do with myself, and I don't want to die, I'm too scared, but it also hurts so much. I want to feel better before I'm too deep to get out of this. I want a way out that doesn't end in me commiting suicide. I have seen so many suicide notes here, of people going though things so similar to me, and I am so scared to become another suicide note in this ocean of corpses that has amassed here."

20f ,70kg,not somking or drinking, no other medications 
 
GAD , i had TERRIBLE anxiety, every day, constantly, from 2 years, leaving me almost dysfunctional, not being able to study at all whatsoever all these years cuz of anxiety, after taking paxil, in 2 weeks, for the first time ,i felt, okay, like i could breathe.

I feel happy?,kinda? Idk, maybe i just feel ""okay"", but thats amazing for a person who felt like throwing up everyday day cuz of how terrible they felt, right now i m actually feeling pretty good,for the first time in years, i have had a whole week without anxiety, but these side effects are scaring me.

I used to be hypersexual b4 this, incredibly high libido, EVERYDAY, but now ,i dont even feel like masterbating, at all, i used to do it almost everyday and being able to finish in minutes, but now, its been weeks sincs i felt like it, and every time i try, i cant finish.

Also , i was so attached to this on and off boyfriend of mine, but now, suddenly, from having a panic attack if he gets mad at me, and begging him to not leave me, multiple times, crying sobbing over him, to now not even wanting to hang out with him when he comes to town, i feel kinda wierd? 

I liked talking to people, my friends, that eased my anxiety, having someone, but now i m sort of avoiding them, i used to ask ppl to hangout with me and now i make excuses to skip facetimes and hangouts.

Is this normal? Should i continue this medication?

1bk6e7i,GasPurple7305,9,2.0,1711027311,depression,"Life update  What is up my, dudes! This message is probably going to be hella long so choose to read it if you want to. 

First things first, to every single one of you (yeah especially you) I just want to say I’m glad you’re still here with us. I know it’s not easy, but the fact that you’re still here makes me happy. Don’t give up!

Now, on to me…It’s been awhile since I’ve last posted in here. Let me tell you a few things some of them are good things. I started dating the sweetest, wonderful, and most amazing guy ever (we’ve known each for about 4 years.) 

We started dating in September of last year and he has been the best person to come into my life. He is so thoughtful and so caring. He knows about all my mental issues and my family my/ home situation. And he doesn’t judge me for that. He loves me for me. 

I recently got my permit (I am an adult btw I just never knew how to drive please don’t judge me) and he’s been teaching me how to drive and I finally saved up enough money to buy a decent car and I’m so happy. I’ve worked so hard to get this far and I’m glad he was apart of it. 

I really can’t wait to marry this man and have a family together I know it hasn’t been that long since we’ve started dating, but we’ve already talked about it and even his mom asked when will he propose haha. I’m looking forward to it. 

Now on to the shitty parts…Well I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (damn fam you couldn’t let me inherit a mass fortune?) and I have depression on top of that too? Not to mention pmsing. I feel really bad for my boyfriend I’m glad he loves me even when I go a little bit crazy sometimes lol

I am currently on three medications and I’m just really tired of having to keep to a routine schedule of making sure I take them. I don’t really have an appetite anymore, like I’m hungry but every time I try to eat something I can’t finish it and I just want to go back to sleep. 

I feel really weak and tired. I haven’t been sleeping either ( my psychiatrist prescribed me an antipsychotic that’ll put me to sleep, I’ll give it a try.) sometimes I don’t even want to get up to pee and I’ll just hold it until I can’t no more and then I’ll get up to use the bathroom. 

I haven’t taken a bath in two weeks and I feel disgusted with myself and I told my boyfriend that and he tells me “Babe you’re not disgusting, I love you and I want to help you.” I think I’m about to start my period and this bitch is taking her time coming, so I’ve been extremely moody and irritable.

Practically every night I’m on the phone with him crying uncontrollably (sometimes till I pass out like a baby lol) and he’s always there to comfort me and tell me it’s going to be alright. 

He is my light and one of my favorite person ever. He gives me a reason to wake up every day (even though sometimes it’s really hard to) because I look forward to us sharing a lifetime together and build a family together and strengthening our bond. 

My dudes…He is indeed the one! The tunnel may be dark right now, but just keep going and you’ll find the light. (That was cliche and cringe lol but no seriously though keep going, because you’re amazing and we all love you. Also you’re a bad ass bitch too!) "

I'm sorry for being alive honestly I'm shocked I'm still here. I love you all I swear you guys are the reason I made it this far. i just feel so drained I don't feel like I'm gonna make it in life, clearly I wasn't made for this world anyway. everyone hates me for no reason they turned me into this when I haven't done shit to them. fuck I wanna be the old me so bad even if I still went thru bad times when I was younger I didn't feel as bad as this. I feel like no one truly loves me except my family. I'm so fucking ugly omd.

Note for mom (translate to romainian for her)
mom I love you so much you've always treated me so well every time something went wrong you were always there to comfort me, even if sometimes we argue we always turn fine in the end. this is not your fault at all you've done your best to help me. I love you so much and nothing would ever change that. I hope you recover from this and succeed in life. I'm sorry I'm dead I know you tried your best to get me help and I know your going to go through hard times when u read this (when I'm dead) school and people are too much for me to handle. I love you so much

Note to dad (translate)

Dad you were always there making jokes and making everyone laugh,I'm sorry I don't talk to you that much I really hope you can forgive me. I'm just too tired to go on living this life I don't even want. I'm so sorry and I love you so much. I hope you succeed in life

Note to isabella.

you were always there for me making me smile, everytime you knew I was sad you would always help me. thank you so much for being my sister your so awesome and you were always kind to me even if we argued we forgot about the arguement like 2 hours later and would go on walks. I'm so sorry one of your sisters is dead but I can't go on I've been trying for too long. you were such a big part of my life in the best way possible. thank you so much. I love you don't forget to stay strong make sure no one tells u nothing that make u feel down and If they do go sort them out because they are all insecure little bitches who are so bored with their life that they make someone else feel bad about their life because they just can't stand seeing someone happy, but honestly stay strong don't let this bring you down. i hope you succeed in life

Note to sister

You were nothing but funny and calm, everytime I was mad or sad you would always make me feel better, youd always argue for me with no hesitation, like I wrote about isabella, don't let this bring you down, you guys have eachother and that should help, please don't let me bring you down stay strong and tell rude people to fuck off because they aren't worth your precious time. I love you so much. i hope you succeed in life. you went through so much yet your still alive, your a true survivor. I'm so sorry I really hope you can recover from this I never meant to hurt anyone.

note to Zara 

I'm sorry for everything you've been through, I can't believe how much a person could understand me and I thought you should know that you mean so much to me and you should never feel bad because of someone. if anyone makes you feel down it's because their so depressed about their own life's that they try to bring someone down with them. honestly I feel like your the only person I can talk to without being scared that you would leak it. I'm so glad your still here and you got the help you needed, even if you have some bad times it's just a natural part of life, shit happens but you just gotta make it through to prove all them people wrong. ilysm and thank you for being here, I swear I tried my best.

I clearly don't mean much to them anymore. I wanna hang myself so bad rn but I don't want to leave my family, they are the only ones who understand me. I don't want my mom to cry neither my sisters or my dad or anyone else, I'm trying for them. I'm gonna try win this battle I've been fighting for years. I wanna selfharm so hard but I can't because I don't wanna get caught. they thought I'm better and they probably think I'm just making jokes out of school and taking the Mick out of them but I'm trying, this school is filled with awful people that don't care a single bit about what your feeling as long as they get popular or attention, I've been trying to hold myself together forever but I've been getting worse in school. I want to have a future but part of me thinks I won't make it that far. What has happened to me. I just wanna be normal. I miss the girl I was before school. please help me Im so ugly. I wanna slit my throat open. there's no end to the pain bruh. it's gonna continue until I die. life can come with ups and downs but it's been down for too long. why am I still living. why am I not hanging myself right now. please. I'm so sorry if I ruined anyone's life, I'm just a bitch that ruins people lives. I feel so bad for being annoying.I'm sorry for being alive but imma think of changing that soon. Hopefully some day I just jump off a bridge. people at school keep insulting me yet they expect me to ignore it when I'm so sensitive? JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR MY EMOTIONS ACTING LIKE THEIR YOURS!? fuck. school has drained me so fucking much and I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed out. people keep telling me these feelings are temporary but they feel like an eternity. i should of been murdered the day I was born. I didn't mean to be annoying or anything. everyone just ignoring that I'm obviously not okay.  my phone dry asf even when it's not on dnd mode.
nobody ever understands me, please just kill me. I keep imagining myself dying soon anyway. I don't wanna hurt people. why do they always hurt me. I'm sorry for coming into your life, clearly I didn't belong there, I don't wanna see my mom cry or worry but I always end up making her worry. I'm such a bad child. my hearts so heavy

the cycle starts again in a few hours, I don't want to do this anymore, my WiFi always gets cut off at 11 now and it's so annoying because I can't go sleep before 11 even if I try force myself or even relax myself, I'm just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of my thoughts and this note, schools making me so depressed right now. my bffs have their own bffs that obviously mean so much more to them, my friendgroup cares about radiyah more then me now even though she just joined it, so much for inviting her in because she was being left out of her other friend group. now I'm the one getting left out. our trio was perfect until she joined and made it four people. three people now. they replaced me, I feel so empty bro. all I do is start arguements for no reason man. I wanna kill myself but I don't want people to feel bad.I can't stop crying my heart hurts. 3 year friendship gone down for a 3 month friendship. I feel so unloved. I love too hard man, I don't feel like anyone understands me. I saved someone like me though, she's getting the help she needs now. she said that she couldn't of done it without me and that makes me feel better but I still feel like shit. damn people really hate me huh. I love my family so much, I think they love me too. I enjoy playing with Isabella but at night when she leaves the thoughts just come back. I think I have depression. I can't go a day without thinking of killing myself. there is no end to the pain.
I hate school so much it's 6 hours of expericing hell. no one understands me there even though they all think they do. I wish someone understands me. is this world even real. the only thing getting me through life is music and my family. without them I woulda been dead rn. I keep trying to starve myself but I can't turn down food. I'm scared people won't like me because of my body and my hipdips. this world is shit. it's all gonna go down one day. I'm so happy our lives are temporary. people with perfect life's make me jealous.  why can't someone truly care for me. every night, every time I'm alone, every time it goes quiet, before I'm about to sleep all I can think about is ways to kill myself. I'm only 12. please stop my pain. I just want to have a fun happy life like the other people, I wanna be skinny,pretty, funny and all that. I feel so fucking ugly. I love my boyfriend even though I get obsessive over him he still calms me down and stays with me. he's someone other then my family that understands my feelings. I think he's the person that knows the most about my life.


26/2/24 11:19

I don't have anywhere to put my feelings except for this note. I don't think anyone understands how bad I've been getting. it's been like this for over 1 year, thinking about suicide everyday, selfharming, getting angry for no reason, I just want it to stop. I just wanna feel like a normal person. these teachers are making me feel like shit even when I'm trying my best. ""(name) what is this , this isn't enough"" clearly plastic surgery won't be enough for you. fuck. stop making me feel like this. I feel like a shadow everyone ignores. I lost all my friends. I hate my life, why does it have to be this hard. why can they have the perfect life and be happy after they destroyed mine. why aren't they getting karma. fucking dipshits. I just wanna cut myself untill I bleed out but it's not like I can because wtf am I gonna do if it doesn't work? go around walking looking like I'm some zebra? no thanks. fuck I just wanna kill myself. but I don't wanna leave my family behind me. they care about me so I don't know why I feel like this. I ordered stuff online for 10 quid so atleast I have something to look forward to. I barely made it through today, everyone's just messing about and talking to me like I'm some type of animal. I've done nothing wrong I don't understand why they keep doing this, they know how it makes me feel yet they keep fucking doing it. what are these heartless dogs doing in school ""this school will help you with bullying and mental health"" clearly fucking not because I'm getting bullied Infront of you and your choosing to ignore it. my eyes for school just fucking worsened I don't think I'm making it far in life. at this point not even music can help me get through lessons, I hate everyone here. please just stop hating me I don't know you. parents need to learn how to raise their children because clearly this world is going to shit.  I always end up setting a date for my death but I never go through with it because I'm such a pussy. I just wanna feel alive again. I fucking miss my old self when I didn't care how I looked, what people were saying to me. I just wanna escape this life.  no one will ever understand me even if they think they Do. no one knows me more then this note knows me. ""give me Ur phone"" ""no"" ""are u hiding something?"" yes this fucking note since everyone wanna be such a bitch to people who haven't even done shit. I just want someone to notice how unstable I am and not make fun of it. I miss how fresh cuts looked on my wrists but I can't do it  again because I'm in forced recovery. cutting my internet at 11pm isn't gonna do shit with me being late for school. it's my desire to die when I wake up making me late. ""Ur too young to feel like this it's just a phase"" clearly it fucking isn't because I've been in this phase for so long I feel like I'm never getting out.

7/3/24 11:04pm

I fucking hate school so much, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. all the teachers think they understand me and that I'm just a bad person but I swear I'm not. I'm not trying to be late or have an attitude i cant fucking help it. they texted my dad about how im being late too many times like wtf atleast I actually came to your lesson instead of not coming. ""wheres your homework"" idfk bro I was tryna kill myself the other night because of this shit hole. they all want me to do better but they don't understand that I'm trying. this world is so fucked up bro I feel so bad and stupid. I don't think I'm gonna make it far in life. I literally hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my mind. why am I like this. I just wanna be happy please I've done nothing wrong. I wanna become the best version of me but obviously I can't. this life feels impossible. I already settled on my decision to kill myself soon. even if I don't want to I know its for the better to just leave my family alone, even if it will make them feel bad soon they will realise I was a problem. I walked home from school crying and atleast someone asked me if I was okay. this world is such a fucked up place. what did I do to deserve this. I seriously hate my life. I'm gonna kill myself but I just dont know when. no one understands me. their all fooled by the fake version of me that I put on. I'm nothing better then a freak. I just want to be a child again.

1bkgevy,Reasonable-Courage39,2,1.0,1711052585,depression,"This hurts so bad…  My (20f) boyfriend and fiancé (20m) of two years broke up with me almost two days ago. He was an amazing boyfriend. He was my person. We were going to spend forever together. We were forever and always. He was my best friend. I had my mom and him and my best friend who goes to college several hours away. I’ve come close twice to ending my life in the past 48 hours. He was my life. Life just isn’t worth living without him. I tried talking to him, but his mind is made up. I couldn’t sleep last night. I kept waking up from nightmares of him with other girls and being so happy and loving with them. I shivered and sweat all night long, bawling my eyes out. They never teach you about heartbreak. This is the worst pain I have ever felt, and I’ve gone through an IUD insertion. I have less than a half a semester left of college before I graduate and I just don’t think I can do it. We have biology together and I struggle a lot in the class. He says he’s going to withdraw since he doesn’t even need it. He’s going for an EMT certification and he only needed so many classes. I can’t focus and I can’t eat anything without throwing up. Drinking juice is too much. I know I caused it all and I hate myself. I know I shouldn’t deserve to eat or do anything for me. I feel so empty and just utterly gutted. I just want to die, I don’t want any feeling. I don’t want to feel this. I love him so much. I always will.

We planned to move away and start our own family.

I’m blind-sided. He tells me that we’re just too different from each other. (Aren’t many people in good relationships different from each other?) My head is swirling trying to remember details. We have little arguments and fights over stupid things, and I’ve learned that I start most of them, but I’ve been getting better at resisting and just becoming more chill and sensitive. We’re both stressed and exhausted. He says he’s tired of all of the fights. I always try to help him with anything, and he spoiled me. I would clean his house when he didn’t have time. He says we’re toxic. I promised him things would change. I gave him some time but I couldn’t keep myself from him. I got him his favorite breakfast and a nice coffee (he loves coffee) this morning and tried to figure things out, mend them. I tried to stay calm. I ended up begging him and he just told me to go home. I was crying really hard and he looked me in the eyes and said “see how I’m not even crying? I don’t care anymore, I’m done. We’re done. You need to go home now.” He’s not one to really cry and show emotions like that. I’m his opposite, and I cry all the time over everything.

 I fucked up so bad. He told me to go date other guys and forget about him. He told me that he’s already begun to forget about me. I could never. I could never move on and date other guys. I love him with everything in me. I love him so much. I’m lost. I wish I had a Time Machine. This all started over me being upset that he didn’t want to come see me when he had promised to come help me move some stuff out of the house so he could move in when his lease is up in June. I really wanted to see him and spend time with him. I want him so bad. "

I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember, been in therapy since I was 11, yet I still can't function properly. I take 100mg zoloft a day but I'm not even sure if it's helping that much anymore, I might've reached a plateau.  

Lately things have gotten worse, it's not the first time that I'm unable to go outside or take care of myself, I'm so drained I can't even resort to my destructive coping mechanisms - but I've never hated myself this much. I can't stand to look at my body. When I stare in the mirror I see a stranger: a deformed, grotesque, pustulate, monstrous figure.  

I'm scared of being perceived, I don't want people to see me. I wish I didn't have a physical form. I don't know how to explain it, but it literally pains me to exist...I feel trapped and suffocated inside my cage made of skin.  

I got a bit over my self-esteem issues a couple of months ago and I started taking pictures and stuff for the first time, I was content with my looks, but I now spiral into comparing myself to other people, feeling inferior to them or being in denial to the point I can't even recognize who I am.  

Please do not try to comfort me with comments about my appearance because it only makes me more afraid of it.  

Do you also struggle with this? I know it's some kind of body dysmorphia, but I'm not sure what to do about it. Yes I've talked about it with my therapist and I haven't found a solution yet. Yes I've been bullied in the past. And yes, I know that looks don't matter as much as we all look the same when we're 6 feet under."

But in the end I couldn't, my father stopped me, he literally begged me to not do it , saying that he already lost his wife(cancer if you are curious) and he couldn't stand losing a son. You must understand that my father has always been rather stoic with me, so seeing him begging was very impactful....I mean,I was convinced and still am that my father raised me not out of love but rather for a sense of duty or in honor of my mother.  What I am trying to say that we have never been closed. Regardless of my attempt I could never been the male son that he wanted or deserved. So having such strong reaction from him was surprising. Continuing the story, my father made me promise that as long he lives I can't end myself. So I tried to get better , I followed the classical guideline to deal with depression. I went to a psychiatrist, I started medical treatment, psicological counseling and changed in life style(more sport,new diet ecc.). Also i decided to restart college and take my degree. I wanna make it clear that I put some major effort in solving ,but regardless of all this ""effort"" my condition didn't get better .

Read (very long) desc Hi I’m 15 and have recently been going through some things so anyway about 2 months ago I started feeling depressed (I’m not diagnosed with depression but do get ‘depressive episodes’ if I can call them that) and it got to the point where I would only eat like some pasta every 2 days, never washed the bowls either just left them in my room where a few of them grew mold (yes mold) I would sleep all day, never showered or changed my clothes and started having thoughts of suicide and sh (has been a thing in the past especially last year but am 4 months clean) anyway I’ve only just started to come out of this and have started feeling a little better again but I don’t feel happy when I stay awake in the daytime. Like it’s not my sleep pattern because I can change that whenever I want that’s not a problem but I just hate being awake in the day. So recently I have been waking up at about 8pm and then staying awake all night and at about 6am, that’s when I have a shower, get dressed, make my breakfast, wash my clothes and clean my room. Basically everything you would do in the day I do at night. And then at about 12am that is when I will go back to sleep. So last week was when I started to somewhat get into a routine again. I am still struggling some days with showering and changing my clothes but apart from that this weird schedule has kind of helped me a little. Anywaysssss I’m just wondering like is it just me and why does my brain want to do this😭 Also does anyone know if this sounds like depression, bi polar or if I’m just lazy because I’ve had people tell me all 3. My family on my mum and dads side both have history of mental health problems like depression, anxiety, CPTSD, BPD and I am on the waiting list for an appointment for an ADHD assessment 
Edit: this feeling of depression usually comes when I go through something that triggers me such as having to move from one care home to another or having an argument with a family member. But it does also come randomly but if nothing triggers it, it’s less severe. I also don’t go to school at the minute because of any reasons. Thanks for any help you might give!😁"

Its been so easy and yet a part of me wants to just go dark on everything, not talk to anyone and just live this easy stable life like what many have done before me.  


I used to be so productive, doing so much but only making little money as what I am doing now.  
I am making 22 grand a year, more than what I have done working for jobs that I studied for and aimed for.  


Why is it so easy to look at this easy life and go ""Yep I want to give up"".  


The only thing holding me back from going dark is the fact that I live with someone who would crash down my door and ask me what is going on.   


Yet I still somehow want to self sabotage myself. I did this years ago with a really good job. And it has slowly affected my own interests.  


Kind regards,

Me

From then i drowned in a severe form of depression since i got slapped around infront of alot of people i know and did nothing about it like a coward and there is nothing i can do about it( i live in Libya which is a failed state where there is no such thing as police, citizen rights or court, it is basically a jungle)

I’m so nervous before I do anything because I feel like I’m not good enough to be scoring the goal, or winning the match, or getting the extra pay. I’m always picking myself apart, my nose is to big, I’m to loud, to quiet, my face is fat,everything. Even when I’m happy in the back of my mind I’m not. I hate putting on a fake show for everyone around me, making them laugh being the funny one wit the upbeat personality.

 I hate feeling like I can’t understand someone because no one talks to be out of sports or school or work. I spend my free time by myself, I don’t text anyone or they jus don’t respond back. If I talk to people in school I’m the only one talking during the convo. I sit silently in the media center doing my hw at lunch. I hate it. I hate the way my “friends” judge me for how I look, calling me a lesbian because I’ve never had a bf and all the boys I did like rejected me. I’m clearly not a lesbian and I hate the rumor they started abt that. I hate how boys treat me, they think I’m ugly. 

Two guys I both really liked literally said “not with you” and the other one I don’t even want to get into how stupid he made me look. There’s a rumor going around that I said I was gonna be a virgin forever cuz I get no play. I hate it. Even when I go to sports nobody really talks to me so I kind of jus listen to their convos and sit in the back of the bud alone. The hockey banquet was so embarrassing, I sat wit a few kids and they all talked amongst each other and I sat in silence looking around most the time.

I'm 34, and financial issues with low paying jobs along with several issues dealing with bipolar disorder  has been taking an extreme drain on my emotional state to the point where I find myself unable to enjoy anything. I can't afford to go anywhere or do anything, am single, find myself unattractive (others may say otherwise but it's difficult to believe them) and generally have a solitary existence. I work alone, do not interact with the person I share a living space with, all I do when not working these days is sleep.

I don't really have any endgame, either. My plan is to accumulate enough money to get myself out of debt, and after that...nothing. I can't even consider the idea of taking a vacation because the lack of productivity causes me anxiety, while continuous work would burn me out.

My suffering looks endless. Instead of isolating, I should die. I want the suffering to end. If I isolate, it could hurt people, but if I died, I wouldn't care. Unfortunately, I can't k1ll myself. Knifes always look like the solution, and I'm not able to even harm myself. 

Taking decision is tiring. Maybe my issues with decision are combined with my mommy issues. Maybe I want someone to take care of me, to reassure me, to make choice for me. Maybe I want a person who'd be a lover and a mother figure. Or maybe I'm just fucked up by milf hentai. I don't know anymore. 

I must not run away, I must not. I'm not normal, I should be able to watch one of my favorite series, I should feel this way with it. It happened once, only once, but once, I needed to imagine someone feeding me because I was hungry but not motivated to eat. It happened once, probably at my worst. Now, I just hug my pillow. I also use my imagination, try to push myself in some dreams. 

I don't know if I should apologize to people, or if them who are wrong. I try to think about it in many ways, and never reach the same conclusion. And again, people have different opinions on it. Some tell me I'm a dick, others tell me I'm a victim, there also are those who says we're all wrong and those who says none are wrong.

There's nothing I live for. Yet, I'm still alive. An hour ago, I was outside, it's late. I rarely do this. Maybe I had hope that something would happen to me, an accident. 

Sometimes I'm hungry and eat a lot. But I regret. I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny enough. I try to achieve my dream physic, but it's impossible. I'm not sad because I'm born a male, I'm sad because I'm born with a male-look. Sometimes, I wanna be a girl, but I also like being a boy. I can't actually be kind of both, I can't change and turn myself whenever I want. Maybe I don't even want that after all. Is it me ?

If you cant do it then dont it

Emotions are Bad all of them

Hobbys are only ok to do if the father does not need to do anything or give you money

Dont do it with force (I never did anything with force but when he saw me for example trying Insert a usb Stick he would loudly talk dont to it with force!)

You do what I say nothing more nothing less I felt like a robot put away If you doont need him....

He bought PC and consols early on, so he had an ez way to keep us silent, I was playing the first battlefield back then I was 6 years old. My mother were never really with us, she work all the time the only sorce of income and was most the time to tired to do activities.

With 18 I became depressed and quickly make my first trip to a clinc and a second one, the third one was becaus of an suicide attempt, at the fourth I got an new diagnosis Obsessive–compulsive disorder becaus of my home live, the 5 one is till now my last one. I cant get therapy without clinics, because I am always so extremely tired that I miss most of my appointments. My tiredness is basically my whole personality I sleep in average 11-13 hours with hughe variety, i slept on time over 24h without any medication. If I am awake I play video games, I have hughe problems trying to learn a new skill, becaus of how much I learned if I cant do it I should not do it.

I basically wait untill holidays so I can meet my brothers, wich I have a good connection with, but outside of that they don't have much free time. Despite we lived under the same roof I am the only one who completely broke (I am the youngest) the rest have jobs one nearly finished his studies, although the one who study has depression. I would love nothing more then do have regular work life, for the money, for some sozial interactions for my self-esteem.

I just don't know why I am alive or what to do with it, I only would wish for a bit more money so I could get a new PC and to support my brothers otherwise I don't have any goals or wishes in live.

i work a first responder job and i feel like i can’t share my feelings publicly or i’d get fired and looked down on as mentally ill. i can’t afford therapy and i have literally not one single friend in the state that i live in. i have extreme anhedonia to where everything feels like a big game and nothing makes me feel happiness. i feel like i have had to back down on every core belief that i have ever had as i look around the world we live in, so broken and filled with sadness that i had to just start accepting things the way they are for my own sanity. i have no hope for the future. i feel no escape or change or ability to plan for the future. nor do i have the energy to keep on keeping on. 

i have seen meds be extremely problematic and the idea of doping myself up just to cope with reality is appalling. i have ruined my appearance with permanent decisions made on impulse and feel like a clown every day. i have horrendous social anxiety which has made it extremely hard since i moved away to build my community, also cant smoke or drink because of job. I understand that my problems could be so much worse. i feel so much shame and guilt for not appreciating my existence. but at the same time, i genuinely do not believe that i was meant for this world (the current one we live in). 

the one thing holding me back is that no matter how much i try to believe in something, logic tells me otherwise. the fact that this could be my one only life and i’m spending it like this is terrifying, but worse ending it all and then never seeing a restart. never existing for all of time again.

My movements are very shaky and it is impossible for me to walk more than a fifty meters without help. This was preceded by a heart issue that was probably caused by COVID. I spent multiple weeks in the hospital because of this, and if I do not pay attention, both of these things might become  chronic. I also have a lot of fatigue. I sleep about 15 hours a day atm. I am also dealing with chest pain.   
While I was in the hospital the doctors told me that all of this might be related to me having a burnout, and they prescribed me antidepressants (which I am not taking). Now for context, I am in my final year of high school. I am active in over a dozen NGOs both on a national and international level, in most of them in leadership positions. I am also a long-term computer science Intern at a good regional university in my are, where I have worked for several years.   
Next to school, I probably spent 70 hours a week doing all of my activities/working for them, sometimes more. I had not enough sleep, no exercise, no time for myself and not a lot of time for friends. I had a girlfriend for about a year, but I broke up with her when she complained that I had no time for her. This has been going on since I was 15, and gradually became more over time. This also involved chronic back pain, sleep issues, stomach issues etc.   
I am going to be unable to do anything for the next 3-6 months, which means that I will probably also be unable to attend my summer internships, of which I had 2 ligned up. I have worked about 4 years on my resume to get where I am, and now it feels like I am losing control. Like it was all for nothing. I don't want to lost all that I have acquired. But my health should be a priority, according to my parents. This has caused friction in the household, and my parents aren't exactly happy that I did not listen to their advice earlier and did less.   
The doctors have recommended that I go see a psychologist in order to sort this out, especially since they suspect that I have a burnout and might be addicted to working.   
What should I do?"

1bkejd2,Adventurous-Owl-8478,1,0.0,1711047960,depression,"I'm on the verge of burnout. What can I do? Hello everyone,

I know that burnout might not really be a type of depression, but I don't know where else to go.

I (34 F), work as a Technical Consultant for a fairly big company. Since I have many years of expertise, my rank is ""Senior"", so I am usually a source of help for other colleagues who need assistance.

I currently have 7 projects where I implement technical solutions for our customers. I have phases where I am extremely productive, wake up early, get a lot of things done. However, I'm currently in a phase where it is extremely hard for me to work. I feel the burden even more because as a Senior I'm a valuable ressource of the company and some projects will literally never move along if I don't work on them. I am both grateful and scared of being in this position. I've worked so hard all my life to get to where I am. I'm single, earn extremely well, live alone and have the best ever relationship with my family. They never ask for it, but I always give them money just so they can have it easier in life and I do it happily. I recently bought my parents a house too. All of these things fulfill me and it's a way for me to express my gratitude towards my parents who raised me. I have no thoughts of self-harm or suicide at all, I am usually very fun-loving and active.

I've been doing this job for 8 years already and the first few years, I was going to the office and wasn't allowed to take the laptop home. Homeoffice wasn't a thing back then. However, ever since the pandemic, working from home has become a big thing and now we work 100% homeoffice. Of course I love it, I can be with my cat, can accept packages when they arrive, can do my laundry, the dishes, etc in between meetings when I find a few minutes and don't have to leave it all for after work, which gives me more time to relax after work. All of this is nice, but for a few months now I've been in an extreme slump. I can't motivate myself to work hard, I don't have any fun doing the job I once loved, I keep postponing everything (and I mean everything) I work on, so bad that it exceeds the delivery date and never gets delivered unless a C-level person literally yells at me to get my sh\*t together. At this point, I'm just surprised they didn't fire me yet because I messed up quite a few times.

My colleagues notice it, my family notices it, I only ever want to sleep, I keep finding reasons to take a nap in the middle of the day (I nap every single working day, for at least 2-3 hours). I used to wake up at 5 AM every morning to go to the gym, but those days feel so far away (even though I was just like that up until the beginning of the year). I don't understand what's happening and I'm really scared of losing my job, but even the fear of losing my job can't bring me to work on anything.

I tried visiting the office once a week in the last month and I noticed I can work a bit better from there but nobody besides me goes there. It's literally a huge building with not a single soul in it. I have the keys to the office and I'm the only one there. It depresses me when I don't see my colleagues face to face. Seeing and interacting with people raises my spirits and makes me work harder (just like going to the gym and seeing other people workout motivates me to workout more than following a workout video on Youtube at home). But it's impossible for me because everyone prefers Homeoffice. It went so far that I even considered the worst: quitting my job at this company and moving to another company where they have less Homeoffice, but even though I've been looking for weeks, I can't find any company like that that's not too far away for me to go to every day. The area I work in just generally does not have a high Office-Working quote.

I'm on the verge of having a burnout, all the symptoms I have clearly point to it and I've made an appointment with my therapist about it, but it's not until a few weeks later due to her busy schedule.

What can I do, how can I prevent myself from feeling such fatigue and exhaustion and how can I get out of the slump I'm in? I feel useless for my company. And the more I feel like this, the more I realize that I define my self-worth through my work, because I feel like I have nothing else in life that will keep me upright. If I give up working and take a sabbatical, I feel like I'll entirely let go and lose myself. I need a routine and a strict office policy to keep me away from home. I even thought about just leaving my laptop at the office so that I'd be forced to go there the next day...

I know it's very long, please forgive me, but I really need help. I don't think I'm in a state where I need medical help, but I'm sure that if I keep doing this for another 1-2 weeks, I will be in a full blown burnout and I want to prevent it. At this point, I'm just happy I recognized the symptoms before it was too late. Please let me know your thoughts and thank you for reading."

My father had been married before he met my mother so I have two half sisters. They are 10 and 15 years older than me. I idolized my sisters when I was younger, but they have always disliked me and my mother. They blame my mother for the divorce (all though my parents met while my dad was in the middle of divorce) and by proxy they blame me. Growing up it felt like my dad favored my sisters, because he would try to make up for the divorce. In fact my mother wasn’t allowed to tell anyone about her pregnancy with me until four months because he didn’t know how to brake the news to my sisters. My sisters always post on social media about how much they love each other. We got a baby book of my niece last Christmas and I wasn’t even in it while my other sister got named “the world’s best aunt”. My father doesn’t stick up for me and my mom is not in any position to tell them off because things are already tense between them.

Because of this, I feel like a mistake. Like I’m a failed experiment or the B-version of a human. No matter what I do I will never garner any kind of success because my value is fundamentally lower than that of others.

I don't have the balls, death scares me, no matter how awful living is. I write my notes and always chicken out, its almost comforting knowing you always have a ""plan B"", yet I never have the guts to go through with it. I've simply decided to not set a deadline. I'm just going to wait for that one day that everything goes to shit and I've got no one to blame other than myself. I want to burn bridges, have people distaste me and loathe me so that I can leave unwanted and not have anyone miss the sad and pathetic existence that is my life. But of course, it's not that simple, people don't work that way, right now I might naively wish they did."

1bke2o0,vents-dreadthrowaway,1,0.0,1711046840,depression,"Tired of this I really dislike my life. So many reasons to discuss. Sadly I have to summarize it since my longer vent I wrote out disappeared when I switched apps for a moment. 

I'm ugly. I'm short for an adult male. I'm a poc and I deal with the negatives from it—the expectations to be a certain way, the profiling, the stereotypes, the microaggressions, the uneasiness. My own people sometimes I feel like I can hardly relate to and they unironically do the most roasting/judging/mistreatment on average. I have social anxiety. At times I feel depressed. I am awkward. I am boring. I have a resting face. I have so much debt accruing it's not even funny. Jobs are extremely hard to get and these places just continue to ghost you and hit you with the same false closers ""we should get back to you on X/Y/Z day."" It's bad that I'm wasting my time going to these places just to hear a soft gust of wind in response. If I'm not a good fit or my availability doesn't work for you just let me know preferably as soon as you can, don't have me thinking if I will get it or not. Either that or they're a scam. Or in some of the obscure places they will pretend the job doesn't exist. One time I put on my formal attire and headed to a far town just for the staff to pretend like they had no idea what I'm talking about as I come in and inquire about the interview they set up. 

I don't have friends or relationship so I can't bug anyone with my struggles beside close family. I cannot relax out for fun anymore due to all the mistreatment and judgement I face for being ugly. I'm hardly taken seriously as a very short man. My resting face offends people and sometimes they will constantly ask are you ok when I am. It's tough to eat healthy like I want to. Healthy stuff is way too expensive. Hell, even junk food now is becoming more expensive. The debt is piling up and I'm getting so tired—I now owe like 10 different places at once. My score is hitting rock bottom. 

Everything feels useless. My life feels repetitive and stagnant. I am extremely flawed. I can never ever shake the feeling that ""everyone hates me."" When I'm kind to others I even have some people using derogatory slang toward me for being so and insinuating that I'm weak. I have people getting offended that I keep to myself but it's like I've been pushed to be this way. There's too much else to write in this rant so I will have to continue later.

I don’t ever want to see myself as a victim instead a survivor. I was sexually abused and raped by a teacher in elementary school. This teacher was someone I trusted and made me feel safe and like I meant something. I was picked on constantly by other kids from 1st grade to 3rd grade. And this teacher was the only one who stood up for me and made me feel important, and for awhile it felt great and fun, until he started to touch me, and I’m pissed off at myself now because I wish I had to confidence to say no back then like I do now. Idk why I let it happen, I let it go on for so long, and I didn’t like it but at the same time I didn’t want to get picked on. When I hit 4th grade the teacher left me alone in fact he straight up stopped being nice to me, in his own words he said “you’re too old for me now”

    He did eventually do time, that only happened after the abuse and when I went through a serious self harm phase. But still he did the damage and I  never felt like a kid anymore. What I’m more afraid of now is this horrible abuse is now becoming more acceptable apparently in todays society, Pedophiles are trying to turn it into a hate crime excuse, they’re becoming teachers, they’re allowed to be around kids, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more uncomfortable just walking around in public than ever before.

So the first time I (F20) went on 25mg Zoloft was back in July 2022, and I experienced basically no side effects besides drowsiness and night sweats which eventually dissipated. Thankfully, it worked like a charm and I tapered off the meds in June 2023. However, the symptoms of my depression/anxiety/PTSD started to come back around November 2023 and I was prescribed the same 25mg zoloft meds once again since it worked great last time.

  
I was definitely not prepared for the side effects I got the second time around, sexual dysfunction being the most annoying of the bunch imo. Before going on SSRIs, I knew that they often came with a whole bunch of sexual side effects like lower libido/erectile dysfunction/inability to orgasm/vaginal dryness/lower sensitivity/etc. But I guess I should've known better than to just assume I'd have the same experience my 2nd time on antidepressants. Luckily, my libido is still somewhat high + I can still orgasm + my body still retains the same sensitivity, but I can barely get wet no matter what.

  
I naturally have a very high libido and getting wet used to be an extremely easy and almost instant thing whenever i got in the mood. Sex also means a lot to me since physical touch is one of my main love languages. My boyfriend (21M) is super sweet and understanding, but i'm honestly just really sad because it makes me feel hollow, like i'm missing a part of my body :(

  
I stopped tapered off the meds again \~3 weeks ago because of how much it bothered me, but nothing has changed. For anyone who's more knowledgeable on the subject and/or has experienced this before, did your sexual dysfunction symptoms go back to normal eventually? And how long did it take to see that progress?"

So far, she's brushed off every instance of me trying to express myself and change myself for the better.

(20F) 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Asperger's. At that time I didn't feel reflected and I didn't want to know anything about it, but after a lot of failures I realized that I am much less functional than I thought. I don't have any social instincts and even though I internalize the things I observe in the rest of the world, I don't quite understand them or feel them as my own. Everyday things like greeting (anyone) make me uncomfortable, it is difficult for me to manage my body language and I have to overthink even the smallest detail of what I do, even with my family and friends. I rarely feel on the same page with anyone and I have never been able to talk to more than 2 people at a time in my life. I don't know how to approach people at the faculty, I'm always alone, and I can only discuss things with my friends. (No one wants to do ""extroverted activities"" with me) I could improve my social skills a little since with practice things start to come a little more naturally to me but essentially I will always be like that.  
It feels a little like everyone is gaslighting me and my only way to roughly guess what to do is to think obsessively about how other people see me. I took antidepressants at the time to control anxiety attacks and my social functioning decreased significantly, to the point that my best friend stopped talking to me.  
I don't want to dwell on how deficient I am, but believe me, it goes beyond my will. I always ran into the same problem and always repeated the same cycle of hope followed by disappointment. I find it almost unbearable to think about what I describe and rationally I feel almost absolute hopelessness. I feel that at least I won't be able to disappoint myself because it is impossible to get something worse than what I expect. Lately I have extreme emotional lability and it only bothers me because it makes it difficult for me to continue with my life, because beyond that my only interest right now is to draw up some guidelines so that my life is less unbearable.  
PS: I hate math and I need to look normal in order to get a job above minimum wage. I write this in Google Translate.

1bjziy6,This_is_not_an_ALTAC,2,1.0,1711000419,depression,"Please ignore. Desperate for attention. Why do you hurt yourself?

Because I believe I should.

Why do you wander?

Because I have nothing else to do.

Seeing pictures of other people. Walking down the street and looking at the faces of strangers.
 It lights the coals of my burning self hatred. To see someone be so beautiful. And me so detestable.
 I thinks it’s part of the reason I’m more interested and more attracted to people who look Imperfect. Especially when they have more weight on them. 

When I see someone truly beautiful my brain immediately tells me to basically ignore them out of fear. My brain puts the dots together for me and tells me I’m sewage compared to them and thus am unworthy of speaking to them and that it’s impossible that a connection could be made. Despite this my mind zooms in on them when I first see them. I imagine a thousand possibilities. I imagine different freak scenarios which I’ve only heard of through word of mouth and movies. Then they leave my sight forever. And I come to the old immovable truth. That it will always be a fairytale. Images of gripping bed sheets and laughing watching movies are extinguished by her back walking away. I don’t know her. And I never will. 

The same girl walks into my sight. Only she’s about 30 or 50 pounds heavier. I’m more attracted to her. Why? Because my brain believes that the chances of her finding me attractive and actually being with her are higher. I don’t believe I’m beautiful. I feel ugly, like a beaten pig. Therefore I can’t believe that others will and that they will accept me. So when I find someone who I think could share the same problems based on quick and rude judgements I find it more believable they’ll accept me. Because truth be told I’ll accept anyone. And I hate that. I hate that I’m that shallow. That I’m that pathetic and disrespectful about people and woman. My mind sees many woman as saviours. As objects for my pleasure. Not just physically but mentally too.

 The toxic waste leaks out of my ears. I have a lot of issues. And I’m scared of loving someone because of that. I’m scared of hurting someone. I’m scared of being hurt. I’m scared of shame.  I’m scared of not being enough. I want to be held and told its alright and I’m perfect and that I don’t have to be anything else then what I am. In the fetal position being held by someone safe. Shushing my cries and whimpers. The saviour complex. An excuse for weaklings like me to ignore their problems. 
There’s this thought that keeps popping up in my head. That if I was American. I’d probably be dead. I would have gone into mams closet and unlocked the gun safe. Then I would have shot myself in the head. So easy. Too easy. I’m scared of that thought yet I want it so bad in my darkest times. Just pick something up and point and click. So quick you can’t change your mind. I don’t know if I’m grateful I’m European or spiteful because I’m not. That eternal sleep. The infinite blackness which consumes me like a warm bath. It calls to me. But for now I must tell it to wait.

1bjalfc,AcanthaceaeNo6440,68,69.0,1710931899,depression,"Give me a reason I shouldn't kill myself I have been suicidal for longer than I haven't been, and I've battled with mental illness for my entire life. I've gotten the help, been to therapy, taken medication, I've even been hospitalized, at no point has it made it any better. At best, it has sort of stabilized me at times. I tried to kill myself 4 years ago, and there hasn't been a single time I can say I was happy I didn't succeed. 


All that being said, my question is why? Why keep going? What logical reason exists as to why I shouldn't be allowed to kill myself? Every single answer I've gotten, whether online or from therapist, is complete and utter bullshit. Every single response can be flipped on itself one way or another. 

""You never know, things may get better, so you should stick around to see""

Things may also get worse, so I should kill myself to avoid finding out

""It's a permanent solution to temporary problems""

It's not a solution to any problem, but it is a way to make myself have no problems

""You only want to make this decision because you're mentally ill""

But what of every single other decision I make? I have a drivers license and I work with children, every decision I make in regards to those is seen as sane. For what reason is suicide the only decision I make that isn't rational? 


""Your suicide would hurt other people""

Any reason given that involves other people isn't valid. There's no way to quantify pain, so whose to say the suffering my suicide would cause is greater than the suffering myself and others would face, given the decisions I make should I stay alive. 

""You don't actually want to die, you just want to right now""

Yes, I don't WANT to die, I've never wanted to die, even when I was preparing all those pills, I didn't want to die. I think death is the best alternative to everything else. I want to live and have a good life, but that is just something I am incapable of doing, for one reason or another. I don't want to die, I want to be dead. "
1bjzgob,OkTrash1696,2,1.0,1711000182,depression,"little rant It’s not horrible to the point of where I can’t do important things, so maybe it’s not that bad. It could be so much worse and I feel bad for thinking that I need more help with this? More help than I can give myself? 

Overall, I’m fine. I think I just feel worse at times when I should probably feel just the usual amount of sadness? It’s like I spiral, or recently, I’ve noticed that there’s this new feeling. 

I feel this panic or dread? It’s like a new low. Like, I have felt low before but it’s now going even lower. Like I’ve unlocked a new part of my depression? I don’t want to end my life, but during that low my mind sometimes goes to that? “What if..” y’know? I know I shouldn’t and I never will because I am terrified of doing something like that but sometimes it just, I dunno. It’s there, and I hate that it’s there. 

I don’t know if writing this will really help? I wish I could just stop feeling this way because I’m really sick of it. I’m thinking about finding a new therapist? She’s helpful sorta? I honestly feel like it’s my own fault. I don’t have any long term goals with my mental health? And each session, she asks me what’s the goal of the session, and I really don’t know. I usually end up talking about something like my social anxiety (I manage it pretty well already, I just sometimes forget about my tools), or something else that’s brief? She helps though! But I feel like I keep going back to the same issues? 

Anyways, I still feel this panic and dread? I’ve cried, texted a friend, did some deep breathing, and even drew something but I still feel it. It’s sitting on my chest and for some reason I can feel it I my stomach as well. I hate this and honestly I don’t know if this is depressions doing? Maybe this is an anxiety thing? But yeah, typing this helped a little.

i’ve had perfect grades all my life. honors classes and even an AP. i just had to ruin it all. i ended the first quarter with such high grades, i was so proud of myself, for once. then all went downhill. long story short, i physically and mentally could not do any schoolwork. my averages became 60s and even a 20. i was barely in school, and when i was, i was skipping classes and exams. i skipped more exams during finals week than i took. 

now for the past two months i’ve been rotting away in my bed. i still haven’t touched any schoolwork. the school and parents and working on letting me do some kind of online schooling. i feel so useless. i started to harm myself. the meds help to an extent, but i absolutely hate taking them. i only take them when i’m forced by my parents, and i only take half the dose. two classmates have texted where and how i’ve been but i don’t have the guts to reply.

what have i done to myself? to my academic career? i’ll probably have to retake freshman year. i was doing so well. now i just sit at home and rot. literally rot. i have to be reminded to take showers, it’s so hard to brush my teeth. i don’t brush my hair for weeks and then cry whilst unknotting the matted nest it becomes. i hate myself. i was my moms shining star. i know she must be so embarrassed of me now, i know i am. my sister is now the shining star, and she looks at me and my matted hair and my trashed room and my dirty unchanged clothes and my ugly miserable face in disgust. she’s told my parents she’s afraid of becoming like me.

has anyone else had to take off of school due to depression? what happened next? i’m terrified of the inevitable consequences. "

I'm just tired, both mentally and physically. For about almost a year now I've been working 2 jobs almost 80 hrs a week. My partner is unable to work due to their greencard expiring and this gives them no option to find a job. I know they try their best by streaming or cleaning or trying to cook and I greatly appreciate it but its still hard. I'm barely home, my bones hurt, and my mental health has all but vanished. All I get time to do at home is maybe eat and sleep. I don't find anything fun or enjoyable anymore and even a smile fades so quickly. My partner already knows the tremendous stress I'm in with student loans and paying the rent, let's just say I barely come out even if not a few hundred bucks under. 

Didn't get my dream job after college and now been working as a maintenance engineer trying to learn and build my career in a different way.  Been working for a good 3 years now still no promotion while I've seen someone newer and less experience get a promotion above me. I've even taken a few electrical and boiler classes in hopes to help more and hopefully build a better future for learning to get paid more and im usually just ignored. Its quite frustrating but as I always say it is what it is and I need these 2 jobs to pay to feed everyone. 

I'm just tired, some days I don't even remember driving home or to work. Don't even feel like eating much just somen ramen most night so i can afford bills. Some nights I just look at the ceiling and think perhaps it's just easier to end it but yet i keep getting up day after day.

i’m not really sure on how to start this so here. By the time you've read this hopefully I'm dead. I've always had a pessimistic outlook on life and I never wanted to live past thirteen. I knew I've wanted to die since I was born. Nothing ever made me happy, Nothing filled the void in my chest. Nothing made my life worth living. The world would be a better place without me. Every single day of my life I've thought about killing myself and after several failed attempts hopefully this one worked. I wasn't smart, funny, pretty or a good person. I'm a piece of shit that got what she deserved. I've always struggled with depression but no one believed or took me seriously. Depression has always been this thing that followed me around and no one could see that I was struggling or even bothered to help me. Not that I have anyone to blame besides myself. I knew the only thing that would make me happy was dying. I've always seen death as a second option. Something freeing in a way. Even if i did get the help i needed i would’ve ended up with the same resolution. I never saw myself graduating or going to college. I'm not good at anything and have no hobbies, passion, or motivation. Senior year has been the absolute worst year of my life and I've never hated myself more. After losing my best friend I knew nothing in my life would be worth living. I'm sorry to everyone I've disappointed and let down. I take full responsibility for what I've done because this is what I wanted. This wasn’t an impulsive decision either. I know this is what I want. I felt numb and empty all the time. I knew I wasn't alone but no matter what I felt alone. I felt like there was this huge gap between everyone else and me. I hated everything and didn’t see the point of functioning in everyday life. I'm tired of never being taken seriously and all of my problems being overlooked. I'm tired of being a people pleaser and being a doormat. Maybe now people will actually listen. i’ve always felt replaceable and like a burden. 

to my family, don’t blame yourself. This was a well thought out decision and something that I've been wanting to do. I'm sorry for being a troubled kid and putting you through the worst. 

Mom: I love you so much. You were my everything and an amazing mother. I know we had our differences but I couldn't have asked for a better mother. Thank you for always being there for me and helping me save up for the car. all of the money can go to you, shanelle & dad. I appreciate you, you have no idea. I'm sorry I never told you how pretty I really thought you were. you’re so beautiful. don’t blame yourself, you did nothing wrong. My favorite memory was our shopping sprees that we’d go to when I was younger and we’d go to macys. 

shanelle (sister): i love you shanelle. you were a second mother. I hate having to leave you but I will still always be there. continue to be the amazing, hardcore marvel fan that you are. I love you so much. you were the best older sister anyone could ask for. I'll miss all the times we laughed. I hope you continue your nursing career. you made me so happy or at least what i considered happy. My favorite memory was all the times we’d eat food and watch our shows together. i always looked forward to that. 

dad: Thank you for everything. You were an amazing father and I will always love you. I'm sorry we never spent much time together but the times we went to dinner were my favorite memories. you’re the best and you tried your best and that’s all i could ever ask for. I know you wanted the best for me and I'm sorry I could not give that to you. My favorite memory was us jumping on the bed together when I was younger. I've always kept that memory. 

maggie: Maggie I love you so much & still do. Even after our fallout I never had an ounce of hate for you in my heart. you were one of the only people who i felt truly got me in my entire life. i’m sorry that i wasn’t a good friend to you and truly wish things between us would’ve ended differently/didn’t end at all. After our friendship ended everything in my life changed and in no way shape or form am I blaming you because once again this is something I wanted. you’re going to be an amazing orthodontist and I can't wait to see you succeed in the world. Thank you for helping me find out who I really am. My favorite memory was when you and I would sing to the customers at cinnaholic and they’d all stare at us. 

casandra: casandra you were an amazing friend to me as well. We talked about so many things and you were there for me and we talked about things I've never told anyone. You are so smart and always knew exactly what to say. You are everything I want to be as a person. My favorite memory was our late night facetimes. 

taylor: you’re so sweet, kind and sensitive. never change. I love you too Taylor, I'm sorry for always messing up and ruining everything. never change. My favorite memory was our bottoms movie day. 

shaleya: i love you so much and appreciate everything you’ve ever done for me. You were the only consistent friend I had and you were there for me all year. I'm sorry I didn't say how much you meant to me more often. My favorite memory was our October spirit Halloween era. 

l christle: i love you so much. you always put a smile on my face no matter what. you were one the funniest people i’ve ever met. you’re going to do great things in this world. i know it. never change either. My favorite memory was that one time I came over to your house and we stayed out really late. 

to all my friends I could’ve said more but i don’t have the energy to type that much so sorry for this shitty letter. 

ps: I don't want a funeral. I seriously don’t want this to become a whole thing and an investigation to happen, just let me die and move on. my only wish is for everyone to forget about me and move on.

1bjtlci,raskolite,3,1.0,1710981754,depression,"I have to restart my entire 2nd year of uni and I haven't told my parents Basically, I (M20) had a mental breakdown this year which has caused me to miss almost all of my lectures and deadlines this past term. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was 10, and this isn't the first time something like this has happened to me. During lockdown I was in my Junior year of high school was the worst--from February to spring break I couldn't do any homework and starting doing poorly on tests because of it. It wasn't that the work was too difficult or that I didn't like it; I've always loved school and learning, but I would procrastinate so badly that I missed deadlines, and I would get so anxious staring at the blank computer screen that I would have panic attacks. I started self-harming to try and force myself to do my work, but that obviously didn't help. Eventually, I told my parents what had been happening and they were very understanding. They created a plan with me, and I was shockingly able to finish all of my late work, and with partial credit I actually managed to get all my A's back.

Despite my repeated troubles I had pretty good grades overall, and I was able to get into a good university in London, which I was quite happy about since UK undergrad degrees tend to be 3 years instead of 4, and I wanted to get to grad school as quickly as possible so I could eventually be a professor. Also, despite the higher rates for international tuition, it was still less expensive than instate tuition at my second choice. My parents decided to use most of our saved funds for college for me, mostly because my older sister had been able to pay for her own tuition by going to community college and working while living at home. My younger sister still has quite some time before she gets to college, and my dad started making a lot more money a few years back, so they'll probably have enough money for her depending on where she wants to go. Still, they did use a lot of money for me, about 30k per year and they also helped with housing significantly (London rent isn't cheap!)

There were some delays in getting my visa, which forced me to fly to London alone (first time away from North America!) and I was terrified. Well, I wasn't scared until the plane landed, since then I realized it was a lot more difficult to figure out a foreign transportation system than I had anticipated. That year was very difficult for me. I was too scared to leave my room most of the time, and it took me a very long time to befriend my flat-mates. I was just so scared of everything and everyone, in a way that I never had experienced before. Still, I was doing fine academically, and I eventually got involved in societies and made some friends. However, I still had bouts of depression, and often got assignments started the day they were due. At the end of the year, I actually missed an assignment because of this, and I had to retake it over the summer for the minimum possible marks. If you aren't familiar with the UK education system, at uni you usually only have a handful assignments or exams per course, and little to no homework or formative work. It should have been easy compared to the workloads I was used to, but for some reason it was so much harder when I had so little to do.

I thought this year would be better; it would be a fresh start; I already had friends and I was much more confident than my first year. However, I still had issues getting to class and doing my work. Especially nearing the end of term 1 I missed several lectures and I was beginning to freak out. When I got back for term 2 I fell hard into depression within a week, being unable to leave my flat for days, even for food. Most of my term 1 deadlines were in January and I missed all of them. I missed the vast majority of my term 2 lectures and I became quite suicidal. The whole time, however, I tried to keep up with society responsibilities, as I knew if I didn't have friends around I wouldn't last. This just made me feel like a hypocrite--if I can do so much work for other people, why can't I show up to class? But at that point it felt impossible, I was so scared of going after having missed so much. Worst of all, I ended up ghosting my best friend from the US because I was too anxious to respond to a serious message he sent me in January. I responded to him a few days ago apologizing and explaining where I'd been, but he still hasn't answered. I think I may have ended that friendship permanently because of my stupid fucking anxiety.

I convinced myself I would watch the lecture recordings and do my assignments and answer my texts and phone calls, but everything kept slipping past me, and I felt helpless. I even tried self-harming again, which--surprise, surprise--didn't work again. I eventually reached out for help when my department sent me an email asking where I've been. Now they're telling me I'm likely going to have to take an interruption of studies. I'll have to redo all of my term 1 assignments and retake all of my term 2 courses next year. I'll be a year behind my peers, my friends, and my plans for myself. I'll have to pay half a year of extra tuition. I'll have to reapply for my visa, and I might have to leave the UK until January, even though my lease doesn't end until September. I auditioned for a musical that's being put on by my friend's production company in London over the summer. I had plans to reach out to my professors to be a research assistant this summer as well. I'll have to let down my friends, and I've already let down my family.

Now I have to tell them what happened before I fly back to the US for Easter break. They were understanding when I was in high school, but I'm an adult now. I chose to go to school in a different country. I chose not to reach out for help when I knew I needed it. I went to therapy for the first time over the summer, but I ghosted my therapist when they reached out for online sessions in the fall. I ran out of my new meds, but I felt like they didn't work so I never got a refill. What makes me feel worse about this all is that my younger sister had to go to inpatient over the fall due to her mental health issues, and she's had to spend the second half of 8th grade being homeschooled. She really looks up to me, and I don't want her to see me like this. She has her own problems, and my parents should only have to worry about her. It's a lot on all of their plates, and now I'm going to add to it significantly. How do I tell my friends, my family, my judgmental extended family, that I'm gonna take a year longer than I said I would? Would I even survive in grad school if I can't handle undergrad? Not to mention attempting a career in academia--it just seems like a foolish pipe-dream now.

I'm so scared of telling everyone, I just wish I could start the year over without actually starting over. I wish I didn't have depression so I could just get out of bed when I feel bad. I wish things could just be easy. I am feeling better now, from a mental health perspective, but the shame is still enormous and inescapable. Sorry this post was so long, I've just had a lot on my mind for months now and I haven't been able to share it with anyone. I made a reddit account specifically for this, lol.

TL;DR - I skipped all my lectures and missed my deadlines due to depression so now I have to retake my classes, delaying my graduation by a year, and now I have to tell my family I failed."

I have been suffering from depression for 5 years
It all started from January 2019  when I became aware that my life after high school would change.
I used school as a distraction because I lived in a really abusive family that never allowed me to do anything or gave me space 
my life practically stopped 5 years ago. 
I've stopped progressing in life, whether it's going out, getting a job, going to college or a girlfriend 
I carry on by inertia for I don't know what because with suicide I would make those few people who love me feel bad 
I don't know what to do now, I would like to take my life back but 5 years of youth spent like this are too bad. 
I haven't had experiences that other people my age have had and I feel wrong about it "
1bjzww0,AvengedClayFoldX95,1,0.0,1711002014,depression,"It's too late for me I'll start this off by saying, no im not suicidal. So I apologize because I know the title gives off that vibe. I'm more so just needing to vent. 

I married my high-school girlfriend, and we were together for 10 years. I gave her the world, worked my ass off to the bone, so she could pretty much have and do whatever she wanted. She never knew financial struggle. However, what we built for 10 years, took her 10mins to completely destroy when she cheated on me. And it fucking BROKE me. Took me a long time to heal from that. 

Now here I am, about a year and a half later, and been trying get back out there, but I'm worried it's too late for me. I'm almost 30, outta shape, and would be generous in saying I'm a 5 outta 10. I fear I won't meet that special someone again. Hell, I don't even know how to talk to women. I get to shy and awkward. Due to my looks, I probably come off as creepy. 

The worst part, I'll never have a family of my own. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted that sitcom life, ya know? A wife and a couple kids. But I feel that ship as sailed for me. Guess I just gotta get use to it. 

I've tried all the dating apps, and it's always the same story. I'll swipe right on 1000 girls, and the only time I get a match, is when it's either some bot, scam account, or some chick promotion her OF.  

It's really fucking with me mentally. All my friends have their families now, and here I am. The dude that was blinded by love and didn't see the snake, and it's too late for me to recover and have the life I always wanted. "

So here's it to read. But on like a more serious note these are like my actual thoughts I just don't like admitting I have like mental health issues and can't take literally anything serious. but like if you have the time read through this and give me your thoughts. It's long so you can just skim it. 

""I don't really know how I feel rn. I don't to want to die, but fading into nothing sounds pretty nice. I don't want to sleep, I just don't want to exist. I want to go lay down in the grass and leave my body to the ants. I don't feel like living, but I don't want to die. I can't see my future. my future is what keeps me alive. but I can't see it now. this isn't good. this is dangerous. my eyes are watering and its washing my moisturizer into my eyes. it burns. I don't want it to. I can't keep doing this. I don't know if I can keep going. this is really sounding really not good. I think i might need help. I don't feel like a burden to those around me. I just don't think they would care if I was gone. I feel like I take up to much space. I think I should just disappear. I want to go outside. it's dark. I just need to feel something real under my feet. my window looks very jump outable. I have a song stuck in my brain. it's from a romance show. I need human connection. I don't have any. no close friends no close family no partner. I see people falling in love on TV and telling each other things. I can't do that. I have too many walls. nobody can know me. I feel alone. unmissable. but no suicide for me haha. I'm not that crazy. I'm just writing about how much I wish I was gone on a Tuesday at 9pm. I'm not crazy. I've thought about self harm, it doesn't appeal to me. I don't get it. pain makes me feel something. I feel like nothing. nothing is nice. nobody cares about nothing. people care about something. something can't stay in bed all day. something has to shower and do stuff. I don't want to be something. I want to be nothing. fade away into black. feel the earth swallow me whole. at least then I'll be held. I feel cold. the draft in my room moving the hairs on my arm. the black doesn't look cold. it looks warm, like a bed. not one with a million pillows to throw off. one that has just one big soft thick blanket you can lose yourself under. I want to be smothered by that blanket. I think I'm done here, but I don't feel done. I just want to feel like a whole, or to be nothing. ones easier than the other. maybe nothing is the better option. nothing is waiting for me. I can be myself with nothing. because I am nothing. worthless. and I'll always be that way. if I go to therapy and get healthy I'll still be me. I'll always be me. completely useless, inside and out. if I'm going to be useless I might as well be nothing. at least then I won't be the random piece of broken plastic in someones junk drawer. if I had to call myself an object it'd be that. nothing to be desired, just there. just something that's not even worth the time to throw it out. just sitting stuck forever. and that's the end of it. curtains closed. when I will lay on my death bed, I will be the same as I am now, so why wait."""
1bjzni5,sooicidalthrowaway,1,0.0,1711000917,depression,"I don't even know if it's depression Every day I wake up and the world feels dull. Like one of my senses is missing, or a color has been removed from my palette. It feels like I'm following in footsteps that were carved by a beast millions of years ago, and I've been told to follow the trail even though it's been buried under the soil for a millenia. I suppose it's hopelessness, the feeling that things won't get better and that no matter what I do there will always be a hole in my sinking ship, but I don't even know if it's that.

My own thoughts differ from my actions so much I'm starting to get confused on who I really am. When I talk to my therapist or family, I'm self-aware and self-hating yet willing to make a difference. When I talk to strangers I'm outgoing and funny. When I talk to friends I'm loud and entertaining. When I'm alone, I'm just a piece of the wall. I fill in the spaces left by others and exist there until another hole opens, and I move to that one.

I went to college because I was told I need to to get a good job. I was told I need a good job so I can make money. I was told I need to make money in order to live. And I'm told I need to live because those around me will miss me if I don't live. I'm tired of being told this same order of events. I'm tired of being told what to do, yet when I'm not told what to do I don't know what to do. So I don't do anything.

I started college and by the second semester I was barely going to classes. They just don't feel challenging. They always were interesting when I went, but they felt ultimately pointless. It's all things I've either heard before or just simply felt unimportant. I tried multiple subjects, tried multiple classes, but every time I would just sit in the back of the room, under stimulated and barely conscious of the world around me. 

And then there's the assignments. So mind-numbingly boring that I wanted to slit my throat with ever written word, with every corrected comma. For fucks sake after hearing about APA style for the 30th time, you start to stop giving a fuck about it and just write however the fuck you want, because that bitch who just assigned 14 pages on a dude who died old and racist because ""he had such a huge impact on the world."" I DONT GIVE A FUCK. Stop telling me what I have to know. Why can't I figure out what I need? Why do I have to be told that this is what's known, this is what's necessary, this is what you need this is what we need, this is how you do this. FUCK OFF. 

That's not really the problem. I'm just tired. Anyways, on the rare time I managed to sit through the assignment and finish it, it was a coins flip if I'd actually even remember to turn the damn thing in, because ADHD decided that my brain will develop at about half the pace of the average human, so hey I may be 20 but I have the mental and emotional fortitude of a 15 year old, anyways time to pick out what I want to do for the rest of my life!

1bjom31,xXBea_altXx,6,0.0,1710969263,depression,"Everywhere I go, I feel alone. TW mentions if alcohol and brief mentions of self harm.

I have suffered from depression and pretty high anxiety (not gonna pretend it's the worst but I have sometimes month long periods where I can't bring myself to go outside because people make me so anxious) since I was 12, I'm now almost 18. 

August of last year I had decided to kill myself, and I had that same thought I'm sure all of you have had, that if I do this I can't turn back. So I decided to give life one last chance and take no bullshit from anyone including myself (that's a different story but none of this has happened and I'm far more miserable than I was before, college is insanely stressful, my hair has been falling out, and I think I scratch my head in my sleep since I regularly wake up with my pillow covered in blood which is new for me). I moved across the country and started studying animal behaviour. I am generally a very polite person, I care deeply about people around me, and I would jump in front of a bus to save a stranger, yet it seems nobody around me cares how caring or insightful or interesting of a person I can be? Every friend I have made constantly treats me as an after thought, I've never once in my life been invited to do something outside of school with anyone, or really in school. It's not like I'm not talkative either, and I would say I'm pretty funny, but since every friend I've had in my life has ditched me, or screwed me over, or shit talked me behind my back. I can count on one hand the number of people that have stayed around through my anxiety and depressive attacks, and due to their circumstances they aren't around much. I've noticed I've started to become spiteful, which I think is fair enough. Every time I look around and see people laughing with their friends I get so upset, why do those people deserve to be happy but I deserve to live in constant misery by myself??? And sometimes I think quite violently because of this and that's pretty upsetting to me. Obviously I would never act on any of this, and I would rather self sacrifice even for people who don't give a fuck about me, but it hurts so much to do that and it's such a lonely existence and I just don't understand what keeps leading me to this situation. Why am I always an afterthought? 

The first time I seriously hurt myself, I had been planning my birthday for months with my friends at the time, we were gonna go camping, get drunk and smoke, listen to music, watch films and all the usual stuff. They all cancelled on me the literally day of the event, I had already packed my things to go. I broke into our alcohol cupboard and drank 2 bottles of vodka and watched a Michael Myers movie alone at 4 AM. I started thinking and I seriously couldn't handle being alive and I slammed my head into my wall over and over until my tears and a small patch of blood stained it.

Why can't I just be one of those people at the bar right now, not a thought in their head, dancing, having drinks and laughing with their friends. It just feels so unfair, why can't I be born as someone else?

I feel infinitely more alone in a crowded room than an empty one since at least the silence doesn't bite. 

Thanks for listening to my rant :)
Much love"

I will start off with my personality in school, I was very shy and quiet, which instantly made me a target. Basically in year 8 I was hanging around with this group of boys and girls, a lot of them would date each other and then I was left on the outskirts, constantly being excluded. They would constantly ask me questions like why are you so quiet in a mocking tone, which used to infuriate me. I used to walk around school on my own and leave school crying because I felt so isolated. I was also dealing with my sexuality back then so i felt further isolated. These group of girls which I considered my friends actually assaulted me once, by nearly blinding me, and because I was so embarrassed I did not tell anyone at the time. I fell into depression at the time.

They would make fun of the way I talked, walked, and used to cyber bully me too by calling me mocking nicknames, e.g. my contact name saved in their phone. At one point I was actually scared to go to school, because they would spam my phone with horrible messages. In Year 11 I got a new set of friends and they used to lock those friends in classrooms, and my school, the toxic hell that it was, never did anything about it. Anyway, I graduated high school, got a 2:1 in my degree and I am doing well sporting wise. I was so filled with anger at the time, and honestly I wish them all the worst in their lives. That feeling of exclusion and being ostracized, I can still feel to this day. It makes it hard for me to trust people. However, to everyone currently being bullied, just remember that revenge is the best success. They won’t be able to stand how they treated you back then.

I'm tired, I need someone to lean on but all my friends... They don't feel like the type I could vent about all this crap. I go days without talking to someone verbally yet even when I text people daily, I feel so isolated.

I don't know what to do, I need help but I'm too tired and on edge to get more help."

1bjqlx2,metal_spellcaster,3,1.0,1710974083,depression,"almost exactly one year ago I found myself too scared, anxious, and uninterested to get out of bed. I started medicating and taking my mental health more seriously. Once again I face the same challenge. Though I had been wrestling with mental health on and off for the last several years, it became apparent to me about one year ago that I was actually also depressed. My wife knew as much or suspected as much, but I really didn’t realize it until nearly a year ago to the day.

I faced with an exciting long weekend trip planned. It was supposed to be exciting at least. The day of I became extremely scared and anxious. I felt like almost at once I lost interest in the event I had been looking forward to all year long. I couldn’t get out of bed and I started crying.

It was at that point I finally understood what people who described depression meant. It finally hit me. I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, got sober, and started to really focus on my wellbeing.

A year later and I feel like I can feel the anxiety creeping up. I hate it. I hate focusing more on missing my wife, dogs, home, etc and not on the fun long weekend plans I have. My wife tells me I should be telling my psychiatrist I need something for immediate relief like Xanax but I’m pretty sure I can’t just demand that of my doctor. I also can’t help but feel like even though that kind of thing might get me over the hump that it’s just a bandaid for a bigger problem.

So I just wanted to vent about this. The onus for me really taking this seriously was the fact I missed the same event this time last year and I was devastated I sabotaged myself by not taking care of myself. I feel like things are going much better but despite that I can feel my fears creeping up. Maybe that’s just a part of getting older or something else entirely. I’d just like to think that a year of Prozac and Wellbutrin would help me to be happier and not focus so much on my anxieties."
1bjfe6r,ry_stock,11,4.0,1710946503,depression,"I feel empty and alone 28m. All my life I have treated people the way I would want to be treated. The golden rule, supposedly a great thing to live by but it has served me nothing but putting me to the lowest point in my life.

I’ve never had great self esteem and was a very shy child. This has carried into my adult life. While I am much less shy now, I still really don’t like myself. I tend to search out approval and validation from others, but I don’t really feel like anyone cares. I know I need to feed my own happiness, but it all feels so fake and delusional to constantly tell myself this while not getting much proof from others that this is true.

I feel as if I have no real friends, yes many acquaintances, but no real friends. Rarely do I get people reaching out to me, and if they do it’s mostly to vent or tell me about themselves. I rarely get asked about how I am while I will have entire conversations about what the other person has going on, how they’re doing. I will ask questions and continue the conversation. There is barely any reciprocation and the conversation just does after because they don’t ask about me. And when I get up the confidence to share a cool thin I did with someone they don’t really ask much more. Even the people who I will send funny reels to or a video or anything that I think they might like or find funny, they will usually just leave me on read or won’t watch or listen at all and just start talking about what they have going on. 

There have been many  occasions where I might not necessarily understand why someone does something but I will really make the effort to ask questions and try and understand, and most occasions I do. But on my side there have been so many occasions with my “friends” that they will actually say to my face that “I actually don’t really care” or they “don’t understand, but that’s fine” when I am trying to explain why I like something, or talk about something I maybe excited about , etc.

I also never feel like I’m heard. When I talk in a group everyone tends to talk over me. Yes I may do the same on occasion, but I will apologize after my interruption and ask the person to keep going. Sometimes I just feel like a ghost. People don’t move out of my way, they will bump into me or I will move out of their way. Sometimes I feel like I could disappear and not many people would notice. 

I just want people to treat me like I matter and they care.

Hello, I'm reaching out because I've been struggling with various challenges in my life, and I feel like I need some support to navigate through them. It's been a difficult time, and I'm not sure how to cope with everything on my own.

Since the pandemic started, I've been feeling isolated and lonely, spending most of my time at home. This has led to feelings of boredom and disconnection, especially since I've been studying from home due to the lockdown. Despite graduating from grade 8 and starting half of grade 9 at home through modular learning, I've been feeling increasingly anxious and depressed. I've noticed changes in my behavior, such as becoming more withdrawn, nervous, and experiencing racing thoughts, especially when interacting with others.

Additionally, I've been struggling with perfectionism, which is a new experience for me. I used to be more outgoing and talkative, but now I find myself feeling shy and anxious in social situations. I've also noticed that I've become more self-critical and prone to stammering when speaking. These changes in behavior have made me question whether something is wrong with me.

Moreover, I've been experiencing intrusive thoughts and paranoia. I often find myself worrying excessively about being watched or judged by others, to the point where I take precautions like covering myself with a towel in the bathroom or feeling the need to express defiance towards potential surveillance. These thoughts and behaviors have been distressing and consuming, leading me to question my sanity and safety.

I'm really hoping to get some help with all of this. I want to feel better and learn how to manage my symptoms and challenges in a healthy way.


If anyone has been through similar experiences or has suggestions for coping strategies or resources that could help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Can you provide guidance on what steps I can take to start feeling better and managing my mental health effectively on my own? I'm committed to making positive changes in my life, and any advice would be invaluable."
1bjxli2,No_Working_8726,1,1.0,1710993495,depression,"I have been depressed for so long, I feel like there is no hope It's hard for me to put what I feel into words, so anything I write here might not truly reflect what I am feeling inside. My depression began long ago but different factors along the course of my life have either helped me get better or get worse. It began with school bullying as far back as elementary school, now I am a 27 year old who doesn't even remember what ""mental stability"" feels like. I could go on and on about my mental break downs in school or earlier in my life, but I feel like those don't matter anymore, maybe they do, but it's not what's on my mind right now. What's on my mind is that my life is just pure BS. I have this goal set for myself, but no matter how much I try to reach for it, I feel like it just gets farther and farther. Me and my gf both have the same goals, but she's closer to it than I am, but I feel like my approach to fulfill my goal is only drifting us apart. She comes from a wealthier family than I do, so for most of my relationship I have had to do more work, I am working 2 jobs as well as finishing up my university studies which has driven me insane, I get less than 5 hours of sleep daily, I barely have a social life at all, I can't remember what fun feels like, plus my job, despite being a job I like, has become so draining and hard that I am second guessing my career choice. This is actually my second career choice, I pursued my first one and realized I didn't like it at all, so I went in debt to pay off a study I didn't like and therefore spent 5 years of paying off student loans for nothing (I do not live in USA so University is cheaper here). I have become insanely forgetful, so much so that it is affecting my jobs, relationship and daily life in general, which only adds to my depression, self-hate, and personal image of myself. I try to calm myself by eating, I've even picked up smoking again (something I had stopped doing a few years ago), indulge in heavy caffeine drinking such as multiple cups of coffee and tea. I'm sorry, I know I am not helping myself with this, but I feel it's what brings me momentary relief, I sleep late because of work and university as well as I try to do something I like with the little time I have like watch a movie or play some video games, it helps calm myself, but by doing this I end up sacrificing time I could spend sleeping and therefore only get a few hours of sleep. I know my post is poorly organized, I am bad at wording things out. I can't afford a therapist right now, nor do I have much time either, as I am typing this I should be sleeping since I have to go to work in about 6 hours as of typing this and I am so sad to say that I am not looking forward to it. I could quit my job, but then I would be even farther away from my goal than ever before. No matter what I do, mental stability has become something of legend for me, and stress and depression has become the norm."

I carved into my wrists with a knife until there was blood all over my sheets and floor. I never told anyone until recently. I cleaned it up before my mom could see it when I woke up after passing out. Your veins really do seal up in time, leaving you a fucking mess. I’ve wished I could die every single fucking day since. I’d never felt that alone until then. I knew my mom didn’t care, my grandma and brother bullied me to the point I was hopeless.

I told her everything. How I plan on killing myself for good this time. Everything hurts too badly. She apologized for giving birth to me, and told me if she knew how much I’d suffer that she’d take it back. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I feel validated, I still know she didn’t care, at least not at the time. Nobody cares except you at the end of the day.

I’ve heard people say that when you are in a manic state for so long, it’s usually followed by a depression because your mind doesn’t know what to do with itself and is essentially directionless. If you think of mania as a high, coming out of it can feel like a real low.

I have been down, it’s not really affecting my ability to work or socialise necessarily, but the second I get home I just lie down and can’t get up until I have to again. I just feel low, there’s no other way to describe it.

1bju6d7,Ill_Definition6023,1,5.0,1710983375,depression,"I’m pissed I don’t have noticeable scars  Rant
So I started self harming back in December. I started with burning my feet, I quickly realized I enjoyed not just the pain but the after effects too. I liked having my feet bandaged, not because it was comfortable or got me attention or anything, but I think the little tingles of pain I got throughout the day. I also liked seeing the scars once it was healed, I’m not sure why. I soon switch to cutting my arms, not deep as I don’t want to cause permanent damage, but I do have some faint scars. At first I liked the scars, but the more I look at them and the more they fade away, the more I feel like shit, like I can’t even cut myself right especially since I can’t get it to bleed. This got a little worse when I went to the hospital (completely unrelated) and none of the doctors, nurses or even my family noticed anything wrong with my arm! Again not that I want them to see the scares. But am I really that bad at everything that I can’t even cut myself correctly? 

Today I had to do it again, and got PISSED because cutting no longer felt right. I made one very small cut before I got so mad I had to stop. I didn’t want to go back to burning, so I tried some alternative my therapist told me about, first I held ice cubes to my arm ( the one I cut) I hated it because the water running down my arm made me think of the blood I WANT to see but can’t! The burn after felt kinda good tho. 
The second one I tried was putting a hair tie on my wrist, pulling it taught and releasing it so it hits my wrist. I did this over and over again till my arm was sore and red. It felt good and made me feel better but… 
There was no blood, no scars , no cuts NOTHING ! Just red skin for a few minutes

I don’t have any hobbies/interest. Even games that should’ve been fun do nothing now. I can’t remember the last time I felt happy. Even if I somehow won the lottery, I think I’ll just be on the bed everyday and not try to do anything else.

I lived most of my life with almost no social life. If not for school, I wouldn’t have interacted with my peers. I did hang out with several of my classmates during college and in addition met a bunch of acquaintances. After we graduate, we all just gradually drifted apart.

The same thing happens now. Aside from work, I don’t socialize. The thought about “maintaining” a friend/relationship feels exhausting. To make it worse, I’m having a really hard time trusting people. No surprise that no one tried to reach me.

I feel like I’m just wasting away at this point. Went to a psychiatrist that gave me meds but don’t think it’s good for long term.

1bjs6tb,floppy_gonga,0,0.0,1710978101,depression,"Very tired, but fighting every day Hi there. Made this account 5 minutes ago. I'm a 28 year old male from the US. I've seen some of the posts on this subreddit used as a way of just getting users' thoughts out into the world, and that's what I want to do because I can't afford therapy lol. 

I've never been diagnosed with depression, or anything as much as the occasional strep throat. I have struggled with negative feelings though, about myself mostly, but also about the people around me. My home life growing up wasn't a happy one. My siblings and I suffered a lot of psychological abuse from my dad for a long time. We would get yelled at, interrogated, insulted, etc. over the smallest things, often to the point of tears. When my brother or I cried, our dad would feminize our names (e.g. a name like Joseph would become Josephine.) 

I bring this up because I coped badly with my home life for a long time. I learned that the best way to avoid punishment was to avoid my family altogether as much as possible. I would go outside or hide in my room whenever my dad was home. I would still do dumb kid/teenager shit, but I got really good at keeping it from my parents. There was never really a time I felt that I could ask for advice or ask for help. I developed a kind of independence that I was proud of for a long time, even though I fucked up a lot, and I had to learn a lot of things the hard way. In my mind, relying on someone gave them the power to hurt me, so if I couldn't get it myself, I didn't want it. I actually refused to accept tuition money from my dad because I felt like taking the money would be giving him power over me.

Over time, that pride in my independence started to falter, and it started to feel less like a choice and more like I wasn't actually capable of being open or vulnerable with anyone. When I screwed anything up, no matter how small, I'd rip into myself relentlessly. I couldn't bring myself to start a relationship. I only pursued casual sex with co workers or women I met out with friends. Even my friendships started to feel fake, like everyone close to me was an acquaintance. I carried a lot of hurt, and I felt that I had to carry it alone or risk alienating myself. I felt alone and defeated, often hopeless. Being happy or lovable felt like a pipe dream. Much of this still applies today, though I'm in a better place than I was in a few years ago. 

As of now, I'm in a weird transition phase. I realize that I need to be more open with people close to me, but it's very difficult. I don't want to be seen as weak or incapable, and I dont want to change the nature of my current relationships. Being 28 also, it feels as though I should have this figured out by now. On the bright side, I can accept now that I'll fuck up, and I have to forgive myself and keep moving forward. I want to be a better person and I want people to know me, even if it means letting them know where my weaknesses are.

It's mentally exhausting sometimes, but I'm taking it a day at a time now, and I'm learning how to be patient with myself. I'm pursuing a relationship now with the mindset that I deserve to love and be loved, without bringing any baggage from my past into it. I've also been hitting those weights baby! 💪 It's cliche, but I cant tell you how helpful that's been. 

I never talk about these things to anyone, so if you read this whole thing, I appreciate you. This was mainly just to say something I've never been able to say before, and even finishing this off, I feel relieved just to have put it out there. If anyone is going through something similar, I hope we both see better days. "

1bjm7r6,Visible-Counter7845,2,2.0,1710963375,depression,"Just an ear or two is all I need..  (30M) 
I must admit, I'm not so great at this life malarkey. Feel like I'm not 100% living most of the time, not that that makes any sense but it's difficult to put into words. 

So, I didn't have the best of upbringing. Parents separated when I was 10 in an incredibly unpleasant way. Quickly after that my Mom was in a relationship with now my step-father. I heard lots about my Mom and Father's breakup through the mouth of my step-father about what my father used to do to my mother, so on and so fourth.  I'm not going to go into detail as it still enrages me to this day, still very raw deep down - I believe this is where my troubles started. 
A year or 2 after that - probably much less but what felt like an eternity I started taking severe punishments for things I don't remember from my step-father. Beatings, a broken bone here and there, bruises, stopped from being outside with my friends. Until a relative saved me and pretty much saved my life. (In my eyes). 
I have alot of great memories from living with my relative. In fact, I dont remember a bad memory. But one thing I did miss out on was growing up with and being around my siblings. I did fear for them even at such a young age. Things from the past started troubling me at high school, getting me into trouble and even kicked out of school - but I couldn't speak. I couldn't open up to a single soul. I've never been great with words just the same as I've never been great with living with my own mind. 

Fast forward to 2019/early 2020. The global pandemic. I was a key worker through the pandemic. Going home to my 2 beautiful children and my soul mate after extremely long hours on the job. Not wanting to go home so I could protect my children but never wanting to leave their sides at the same time, a strange feeling that I'm sure many of us had during the many months of the Coronavirus lockdowns. I would cross paths with my partner when working during these times, I'd come home and she'd be off to do her own work working nights on the frontline during the pandemic. At the end of 2020 I took a month off work due to a significant flare up of my mental health, one I hadn't had before. I couldn't bare to continue with my life, I kept this quiet from everyone around me apart from my workplace. 
I went back to work 4 or 5 weeks afterwards, not 100% and quite low , still under the same rules and presures of day to day life under something so strange. After another month or 2 I began to keep waking up during the nights with an awful sense of fear, that ""gut instinct"" kind of feeling. 
I later found out that my partner was cheating on me after 14 years together. She quickly ended the relationship and things really went south with my mental health aswell as our relationship. Lots of horrible things happened as if I'd been some kind of devil, awful accusations ect. I continued to struggle on at work for a couple of weeks when things became incredibly unbearable in what felt like the click of the fingers - I didn't want to live anymore and that i would end my life after this very shift. This feeling was incredibly strange looking back to it now, it was like I had no more worries. As if every single thing that I had been carrying for a huge amount of my life had just been lifted off my shoulders. I left work feeling incredibly low but at the same time rather calm and collected about my decision. I drove about 40 miles to a secluded location and had a cry to my favourite songs, stroked the cheeks of my children on the screen on my phone and that was it, I swallowed 2  bottles of pills, 1 bottle of pills being my antidepressants and half a bottle of co-codamol. I wasn't upset anymore, I was more angry about my short life. I remember going lightheaded and after that I don't remember anything other than waking up in hospital remembering what I came back to, it upsets me still. 

I'm still struggling to this day with these feelings of betrayal. Remembering everything like it was yesterday. I have became incredibly jealous because I feel as If I'm not good enough, not good looking enough,  Don't do enough and whatever else. 

I'm not suicidal but feeling like the end of life could he close and could save me from my tormented mind.

I used to self harm semi-frequently and rarely ever do it anymore but im starting to take up smoking as it seemed like a less obvious coping mechanism (physically) and i hapoened to have a pack laying around. but now im not so sure since if my dad ever catches me smoking (which would be difficult cause i always go for a walk in the street to smoke) he would make sure i never smoke again by doing whatever it takes him.

Over the course of my life (23F), I’ve dealt with physical abuse, sexual abuse/assault, verbal abuse and emotional abuse. I find it really difficult to connect to people because I feel like other people just don’t understand. I was married at 19, got pregnant shortly after and my ex-husband turned into a raging and abusive alcoholic. I left him 3 years ago. A little over a year ago, I shot myself in the chest. There’s no way I should be alive right now. In fact, I did die for a brief period. Yes, I was getting help and on medication. I wanted to get better. But I guess at some point, I couldn’t go on feeling the way I felt anymore. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, and was always trapped inside my head. After all of this, my ex-husband tried to take my daughter away from me and filed a restraining order. No, she wasn’t with me when I shot myself and I never put her in harms way. Fast forward, I have 50/50 custody of her. I met the man of my dreams about a year ago and we are planning on getting married, but he just got two year orders in the Middle East. Now I feel like I’m back to square one. The one person who made me feel alive again is 7400 miles away and I’m alone at home when my daughter isn’t here and it’s quiet. Too quiet.

From there I had anxiety, then a few years ago I had terrible religious OCD to the point I couldn’t eat, sleep, piss, or leave the house. I would also bang my head over and over. After a while my OCD symptoms began to get a lot better. But then I found myself to be really depressed and I’ve had to go to a mental hospital about 6 times.

Watching everyone getting accepted in to amazing colleges and achieving so much in school makes me so jealous and angry and dreadful. My one goal in life was being successful in high school and college. When my mom died last January, things just progressively got worse and I can feel myself falling apart. And sometimes I find it actually unbelievable how many terrible things have happened back to back in my 18 years of being here. I hate that I’m not doing well in school because other people have been through things too but they’re still pushing themselves. Ive never felt so depressed in my life and I think about dying every day.

I think i\`m at my lowest right now, been feeling empty and without a purpouse these past months, stuck in a job i dont want, my girlfriend just dumped me and i constantly struggle with my childhood trauma of abandonment.

I dont wanna give up just yet, i've been there before but this is different, cant feel sad or happy, just stuck. Cant sleep.

Usually i stay up to 3 or 4 am talking to myself, chugging a bottle of alcohol, i know it does more harm than good but it makes me feel comfortable for a bit.

The only thing keeping me happy was my girlfriend, now i\`m all alone, never had friends to begin with, she was both my girl and my best friend. I dont blame her for leaving, sometimes i was too cold or lacked touch, but its not my fault i guess, never knew better.

I'm filled with so many newfound emotions, used to hate myself so much i couldn't look at the mirror. Now it\`s weird but i see myself as that poor kid who had to grow up with no company at all.

How can i stop feeling that void in me ? I\`ve tried therapy, exercise, arts, anything that people would just recommend you and nothing worked, videogames are the only thing i can cling to right now, videogames and alcohol, they seem to be my only friends now.

I’ve been taking SSRI’s for just over a year now and I’ve been having constant problems with dosage. Essentially, I get 1-2 good weeks out of my medication and then I steadily revert back to where I was before - dissociation, low mood, suicidal ideation. 

I’ve been taking SSRI’s in combination with lifestyle changes, I’ve done CBT (multiple times), I’ve been through compassion focus therapy, and I regularly journal to keep track of my feelings and thoughts. I just can’t seem to stay regulated. 

My dose started at 50mg of Sertraline and over the course of eight months was steadily increased to 200mg, before doctors switched me off it and onto Citalopram.

I'm here to present an alternative way of looking at the constant state that is depression. I don't look at it as a stigma anymore, I look at it as a sign. A sign that things are odd and not right. If it's me, Ican sit down and evaluate me, and come up with a way to address it. If it's not, and sometimes, it isn't, I work my way through it until it's something I can do something about it. It's a companion at this point, something that's going to stick with me for the rest of my life. And that's OK. I'll have good days and bad days.

The worst things thats ever happened to me as a kid was being teased and made fun of, beat up a couple times, never had a lot of friends.
I don’t feel any of this is a valid reason to act the way I do.

I first started getting anxious around people at 2 years old, this is when my two dogs passed away and I was alone for the first time in life.I got very shy and cried every day in my moms arms before getting hand over to the kindergarten teachers.
In kindergarten I had 2 friends which later changed to only one. I would get beat up by two brothers. One was a year older and one was a year younger than me. 
It wasn’t horrible. My parents never even noticed.

When I started school I would still cry in the morning, no longer every day but still often. When I reached 3rd grade I started resisting to go to school.
My mom would drag me to the car by the collar of my jacket cause I was staying home one or two days a week and she was fed up.

By the 4th grade I lost all my friends. My teachers thought it would be good to put me in a different class where I didn’t have the only people I weren’t scared to talk to.
Now that im thinking back it would probably not have been so hard to make friends, at an age like that it’s easy, but at the time I couldn’t. 
I kept staying home a lot.

From the 4th-6th I started getting teased for my hair and clothes. I had everything from red and black split dye to purple hair with white stripes. My clothes were always 3 Sizes too big, I would rather be teased for my clothes than my body.

I always hated the way I looked, Even before people started calling me ugly. My skin was to dark, my legs were to skinny, my stomach was to big, I didn’t like how I didn’t have breast. I planned how I could cut off my fat with minimal scarring
I was only 4.

It only got worse as I got older. Now I was thinking about every tiny feature. But this is also not enough to be depressed.
Everyone is insecure

In 6th-7th grade I was picked on for how I looked. From peers, strangers, relatives, even friends. 
But it wasn’t awful. Not like the stories I can see on the internet. My life is easy, so why am i like this.

8th grade. I couldn’t leave the house without insane nausea from anexiety. I went to school for 2 days before I broke down in the bathroom. I never went after that, Im starting collage and I haven’t even gone to school
one
single
day.

I am throwing away my “best” years because im “depressed” when I have no reason to be. I never attempted or anything like that. Never wanted to either. I don’t want to live this way, But I want to live.

Sometimes I wish my childhood was worse. Maybe that my parents were divorced, or that they neglected me instead of being helicopter parents. Not to feel pain, not cause I want it or think it’s cool, I just wish I had an actual excuse to spend all day in bed and feel like shit.

I don’t want to be cheered up or anything, I just need to know if there is anyone else that feels like this for absolutely no reason at all."

My partner has been in a serious depressive episode for about 6 months now. He’s finally getting to a point where he’s ready to seek help, but it is a long process, as you all know! It’s been tough, we are long distance at the moment (he’s moved back with his parents so he can get some support from them, and they live a few towns over from me), so we haven’t seen each other in a while, but we talk often. We are totally exclusive, dating more than a year. 

Lately, my friends have started calling him “just a friend”, and diminishing the relationship because we haven’t seen each other in a while. They’re saying that we aren’t together, it’s not a “real” relationship, and I should move on. 

I guess I’m just bummed, I thought my friends were more supportive than that. I have had depression my entire life and I thought they weren’t so judgemental about it…. I understand that it’s not a typical relationship right now/“on hold”, but it’s because he’s got serious health issues! He’s trying to survive everyday life right now. So dates go on the back burner for a bit.

Are they dismissive because it’s mental? If he had cancer and couldn’t go on a date because of his treatments, nobody would judge me for sticking around…. If one of my friend’s husband went into a coma, I wouldn’t ask them “how’s your FRIEND doing?”.

It’s 2024, how are people still judging mental health this much??"

Hi all, I'm here for help because I'm honestly getting more and more suicidal and desperate and I feel trapped and don't know where to turn. Any advice on tackling this is appreciated. My boyfriend and I live in his mom's basement and have for about two years, ever since our house we previously lived in caught fire. We both struggle with depression and things have gotten really bad. I'm ashamed admitting all this, but the basement can't be walked through anymore without stepping on garbage and clothes. Our possessions are constantly getting ruined and broken in the clutter and our cats have peed on a ton of things. Just this morning a vase I made in high school that meant a lot to me shattered. There are pee bottles everywhere because my boyfriend often feels that's easier to do than going upstairs through everything to the bathroom. One half of the basement flooded a bit and it's wet and starting to mold the garbage and clothes. It will take at least a full week of effort to clean and that's if we don't work which isn't an option. This isn't one of those ""oh, just get rid of the garbage first, then get dishes out, then get laundry in the laundry room, then put all the things back in their place!"" situations (I say this because that's what all the articles online say, but we don't have places for things.) We have too many clothes for our single dresser, we're paycheck to paycheck right now since we're 26 and just put all our savings into starting a business with no funding eight months ago and work six days a week (often seven, business is going well, though, and it's the one thing I'm truly proud of) and only get 4 hours at home each day before bed, the kitchen sink upstairs can't simply get our dishes put in it because my boyfriend's mom struggles with depression too and has years of her own things built up in there, and there's just so much down here and up there TO clean that it feels totally impossible (plus she doesn't want us to touch her things). We only use disposable dishes now, and that makes me guilty too. We don't have many things that truly have a ""place"" in here. We've made breakthroughs on it before and gotten it about a quarter of the way done with the cleaning on several occasions, but our whole life is in a basement when we had a house full of things and everything piles up all the time and gets really overwhelming really quickly.

There's not even a place I'm comfortable sitting in the whole house that's not the bed that we got about a year ago since it's genuinely the only thing I feel like won't get dirt or something on me by sitting on it. My boyfriend's mom has terrible paranoia issues and we could never get the house professionally cleaned as such - she won't even allow contractors in to fix things that could be dangerous to her, everything has to be an emergency before it's taken care of even if we want to pay for it. I know I'm going to need to chip away at things, I just don't know how to maintain motivation and not fall into another long spell in the process. Thanks to anyone who might be able to offer any advice, I appreciate it. "

The world doesn't stop and wait for us to heal.

I want people to know, that with depression may come certain values to a person. It is a horrible disorder that i have struggled with for 8 years now. I don't believe that I will completely recover from this. I know some of us won't. Some of us will commit suicide, some won't find suitable treatment. I know, that it can be treated completely but it doesn't have to, even with therapy, pills, loving people around. 


What i have found comforting, is that, with being prone to depression, being neurotic comes certain sensitivity, that may allow us to understand each other and help those struggling.  I've found myself quite helpful with listening to others, giving proper advice and I wouldnt be able to do so without this depression. It is much easier to properly help others than it is to help yourself. One day You might save someones life because of what You are going through right now. Try to listen to others who you think might be struggling. Not because of selflessness, which I don't believe in, but becuase it is possible to find comfort for yourself by doing so.


This is obvious for some of you but it wasn't for me so maybe it changes anything for anyone. Although be careful, because it can become some sort of escape from your problems and those must be a priority.


This probably wont help those in their worst right now. Those peopleneed to think mostly about themselves and its okay, its natural and important. But try this when you can and are able to.

I try to limit my negativity as much as I can and have worked on coping skills to, you know, prevent myself from trauma dumping on others.

I don't trauma dump and complain like I once did, which is good progress. The damage is still there, though, from when I was a very hard person to tolerate.

Nobody owes you forgiveness, but I wish it didn't hurt as much to witness once healthy friendships just burn out. 

I understand how the other side feels. When my depression is really bad, I know I can be very difficult to be around and talk to. 

It also seems that people lose patience and distance themselves from that person. That's understandable, because I know how draining it can be to be around me when I'm in a depressive episode.

It feels like a lose-lose situation. You lose friendships that you once cherished, and so do the other people.

I’m actually wondering if I’ve been suffering from depression my entire life. 

I’ve always lived behind a dense fog of shame for just existing. 

My parents told me it was weird that I was so young but I’d completely zone on coloring for hours. Dissociating at like 5 years old??

I used to bang my head on concrete when I was little (3/4?). Big emotions that my parents shut down. 

Just the look of disappointment of my parent’s face was enough to send me into a spiral of shame and guilt. 

My parents had to basically force me to eat at times. 
 
I was too scared in 1st grade to tell my teacher I threw up. I barely spoke to anyone in school for years. 

I always cried at the drop of a hat. Especially if someone told me I was wrong after finally speaking up. 

I would sleep for 16 hours a night if my parents allowed me. 

Never had interests. Couldn’t keep friends. 

I have always been utterly exhausted. Never been able to open up to people. 

I learned very young that I’m not my own person. To sit down and shut up. To be seen, not heard. That I don’t get an opinion. That I’m not allowed to have wants and needs. 



I know shitty childhoods are so common but do people ever actually recover from never having been their own person in the first place? Never having separated and individuated from their parents? But at the same time their parents have never been a secure base? "

This all started when I was 11. I just began to feel down about myself. I would assault myself with ""my parents don't love me"" or ""your grades are terrible"". I've heard people complaining that teenagers have ""sad phases"", but usually those go away. Mine never did.

Whenever I hung out with family, I put on a fake smile because I didn't want to show my true self. They all gossip about eachother when the other is not around, so I wonder if they talk about me behind my back.

I turned 13 last year, and I thought surely the sadness would stop, but it never did. It just snowballed into self-hatred. My self esteem dropped. I call myself ugly every day. I usually blame myself for the hell I experience. I never told my parents, nor ever will. I know they won't understand, because they don't care. Hell, I talk with my teachers more than my parents.

I’ve recently just had some kind of breakdown and I don’t know what came over me in that moment. After settling in my desk, I sat there and suddenly started sobbing for no reason. It felt like there was this large feeling in my chest that was just bubbling inside me and it made me feel so horrible. I started to pace around the room and my chest felt extremely heavy to the point that I was hyperventilating. I tried to cover my ears to try to silence the sounds of my own cries but I could still hear it. Thoughts of disappearing or crossing the street to get hit by a car would appear in my head and it made me want to just shut my eyes to not even try to imagine it.

Throughout the years, the feeling has come and gone. Sometimes the feeling comes from ""there is no point to anything, so why not"" or ""I'm just so exhausted; i dont want to do this"" or ""life is too unbearable and its not gonna get better.""

 I have self harmed but not to die, but because I was in too much pain and I needed a distraction. I live at home with family and if I didn't, I think I would just let myself rot and die from starvation.

There's always been this logical part of my brain that overrides my feelings and says ""feelings are temporary; just wait it out."" Lately, suicide just feels like it makes sense. I've tried exercise and that helps a little sometimes. I looked up what to do when I feel like this. I don't think I'll ever use the help hotline. The other big tip was to contact someone I trust to talk about how I'm feeling. But I can't find it in me, to trust anyone right now.

The one goal I’ve had in life that actually mattered to me was to get married and have children, but unfortunately I’ve come to accept that this will likely never come to fruition (I know it’s very old fashioned. I think it stems from the fact that I have always craved deep social connections above anything else, and I kinda view family as one of the ultimate ways to get that.)

My entire life I've been ignored and overlooked and I've felt nothing but alone and hopeless, and this subreddit helped solidify my decision. I've made two posts prior and have received nothing. No one cared. Just like real life. I fit no where else in life so maybe it's just time to fully fade into the background. Three days after my 18th birthday I will overdose and die in my childhood home, in my childhood room. Depression has taken everything from me, and now it will finally take my life. Thanks to everyone who never cared, it made leaving that much easier.

EDIT: First off I wanna thank everyone for leaving nice messages both in my inbox and on this thread. Second, I'm not dead yet. I spent the last 2 or 3 days in bed sleeping, I'm not joking. I would wake up and then immediately go back to sleep so I haven't seen the notifications until today. I thought that I should come on here and explain a few things about myself. For everyone who thought my depression was circumstantial that is incorrect, I struggle with clinical depression which basically means that all the sadness is mainly cause by a chemical imbalancein my head. I should also preface that I am a drug addict, I do both coke and heroin semi-regularly and have been for months as a way to cope with everything going on. And lastly I cannot be saved. I feel bad and guilty basically telling everyone that I'm still going through with it cause now I feel as though I've wasted everyone's time that they spent writing out those nice messages. I especially feel bad for all of the people who told me about their own personal experiences in an attempt to help me. I'm still going to go through with my original plan and if I live then I live and if I die then ig that's it.

Even still, I started the process of writing a suicide note for the first time. It's over 1000 words, not finished yet, but for something I'm not planning to do I am putting in so much more effort in than anything else in my life, really.

I cried writing that letter. Though, researching a suicide method is oddly calming. To me at least. Though I probably shouldn't find it calming or entertaining at all.

1bj2yyp,VerisnHunter,8,3.0,1710902117,depression,"I hate having depression It’s ruining my life. I(F19) have been depressed for 7 years now and each day that passes somehow manages to be worse than the last. I only have positive emotions about life for maybe 10 minutes each week, and then I go back to feeling terrible and empty. I’ve been going to therapy for about 3 years now, I’m currently on my 4th therapist who I like so far, but I don’t feel like I’m getting better. She’s lovely to talk to, but it’s not helping much. I have also recently started taking medication, which I’m desperately waiting for it to work.

I had this stupid thought that when I turned 18, my depression would magically go away. That since I finished high school, I wouldn’t be in pain anymore. But I’ve only gotten worse. I have trouble sleeping and staying asleep and my thoughts get so overwhelming that the only way I can cope is through I self harm. When I started I thought  it was going to be a one time thing, but now I can’t stop.

I also hate that depression makes me feel unloveable, that since I’m sad nobody will never love me, and that I don’t deserve to love anyone because of it. I understand love is human and I crave it so back but I can’t help but think it’s selfish to put that type of burden on someone else, so I just continue to be alone. I wish I had someone else but maybe romance isn’t for me, maybe I’m the type of person who deserves to be alone. But all I want is so desperately to have someone else, someone who loves me and will talk to me. 
Why can’t I have that?

I know I’m young and am probably trying to rush into stuff, but I think I’m in such a hurry because everyday it feels like my world’s ending. Everyday my thoughts get worse, everyday I contemplate suicide and I just don’t know how much I have left in me. Which is why I guess I want things to go well for me now.

And I guess I hate depression because it’s not fair. I see other people live their lives without depression, and it’s just not fair. I don’t want this, I didn’t ask for it, so why am I being tortured. It’s not fair that I have to live the rest of my life like this. It’s so not fair. Why can’t I just be normal, I don’t want to have these issues anymore. Why can’t I just live like normal people, why does my life have to consist of so much pain.

1bj8b6j,DryAccount0,2,0.0,1710921888,depression,"Scared of life Hello. I'm there to whine about myself, write what's on my mind, what's bothering me.
I'm 24, on my last semester, in a process of writing my masters.

What's on my chest? I'm scared of my future. I really do not know what to do in a couple of months with myself. This frightens me a lot. Maybe things would be easier if I rented something instead of living in a student dorm as I maybe would have some idea how this works, but that would be too expensive so here I am. I really feel like I've failed at a game named life, technically simple sounding life situations being massive burden to me, making me feel as if it's close to the end of my life, not that it would be a bad thing in a literal sense. That's just one thing, but seemingly major at the moment, though there are many more things which stress me. What if my master thesis sucked, what if I'd skipped something during literature review for my thesis and everything would be invalidated? What if I suck at work, what if I will underperform at work, what if I say something that I'll regret horribly... this should give you an idea. Those feelings are paralizing to me. I feel insanely lazy, inadequate, procrastinating a lot, which is only making me even more anxious about things.

Another point is that I feel like I'm withdrawn from the society. I'm mostly making only transactional interactions with others. I'm generally interested in some things that are happening for other people but that's another transaction for me. I only query for some information that seems entertaining to me, to know more about someone, but for what reason? Just to entertain myself I guess. I don't find myself being an interesting person, which will only get worse most likely with my graduation. I'm seriously considering a doctorate at this point... but am I smart enough? I basically can only talk about university stuff, but what else? I can't really talk about my job other than that I'm a software engineer. Maybe I could have some small chats about anime. I find myself struggling with conversations, sometimes stuttering a bit, but having difficulties with finding the right words to tell what I intend to, though now when I think of it, do I really know what I intend to say? Funnily enough I can hold whole Oxford debates with myself in front of the mirror, at least I think they're pretty good. For now people seem to understand what I mean so that's a bit calming, though it would be nice if I could speak more clearly.
The previous point derailed a bit, so returning to me being withdrawn, I'm aware that there are concepts of colleagues and friends, the latter being technically the 'closer' one. I can't though grasp the concept of a friend. When someone becomes a friend? What are the things that friends are capable of but I shouldn't expect them from just colleagues? I remember once being to a birthday party of a classmate, when I was much younger but I remember being completely lost there, like I just went with whatever was happening there. I remember one thing that was pretty entertaining during the party though and this was fixing a sound driver issue on my classmate's PC. I've never really liked social events neither at school nor anywhere for whatever occasion, especially family ones, trying to skip as many as I could. A good question would be then, what I spend my time on? I've played games, spent time in my room, pretty much wasted a major part of my life. I despise myself for that. I sometimes wonder what could I achieve if I had some extra push? It doesn't matter now. I am where I am and there aren't time machines. I'd love to remove those last few sentences, since they're extremely embarrassing to me, but leaving them is maybe a good idea to just let it off my chest.

I feel like there's so much stuff I'd love to add, but I don't have an idea what. This makes me feel like I'm a dumb LM model just waiting for a prompt to generate some output. I think that to hold myself together somehow, I will turn to be a workaholic, just to find a purpose for myself, though what I wrote earlier about being anxious of makes me worry how I'll progress throughout my life.
I'm scared of a feeling of regression, my gray cells decomposing as I live, forgetting things I've worked hard to learn and remember. This feeling only grew within me over the years. I'm even anxious that I will accept it at some point in my life.

This should be obvious now, but I think it now connects some previous things - my romantic life being best summarized with a '0'. Do I feel bad about it? It's difficult to answer this question. Using my understanding of myself, I'm pretty sure I've never beared any romantic feelings towards anyone. I'm sure though that the only feeling I've had was pure desire, but nothing more than that. I don't understand what a difference is between a friend and a [insert sex of your choice]friend. I think that the only difference are 'bonus functions', lacking better terms. I hope this section provides a bit wider understanding of how I feel.
So I've established that I'm not particularly sociable, even when it comes to intimate stuff, valuing just the function. Yet I have an unpleasant feeling that I need some kind of interaction with other people, I want some unpredictability in them, but coming out and speaking my mind scares me. It scares me that they will find it unpleasant, offensive maybe. It frightens me that I might say something that I'll regret saying, which could have major consequences. It's not that bad prefering to have a chat with an LLM over a real human as they're not quite on a level to substitute a real human. I complain a lot, but have no one to listen to me, at least in the way I'd feel safe about telling something like what is written there and more.

The only form of happiness I get is when I finally solve some dumb issue, find an answer, everything in code works, that I find a short surge of satisfaction. But it's a difficult source and unreliable and what about the life? I absolutely don't know how to get that just from life.
In summary I don't a lot of things about myself, my mind, my lack of skills, my lazyness, my fear, my body, etc. I'm not sure if I feel better after dumping a bit of my thoughts in this post or if I'm just feeling sleepy, so those bad feelings will repeat themselves again, though most likely they will. I hope that someone will actually manage to read through this pile of chaos. Thank you."

1bid8kn,Watermelon-ass,217,34.0,1710827766,depression,"Raped when I was 6. 
Hey, I’m A, and I want to talk to anyone about this because I cant hold it in anymore.

So, when I was 6, my mom took me to swimming lessons in my old school because I was afraid of water, and I was really afraid of it. I remember that I had two of my classmates also in the lessons with me, so we were 3 six year olds in total. Everything was okay, my swimming teacher, (46 at the time), would always help me through my fear, whenever I cried from getting too scared to swim in the water, he would hug me till I stopped crying and then continue teaching, I was really excited everyday to go swimming because the teacher was so nice to me, but one day, everything changed, it was about 2 weeks into the swimming lessons when whenever I got too scared to go into the water, my teacher would bite my arm really, really hard to get me to jump into the water, which worked, but it did leave me crying at the end. Then another day came and our teacher told us to not come wearing our swimsuits but come fully clothed and change in a room in the school, I didn’t think much of it because I was literally 6 years old, so the next day, me and my classmates came fully clothed as our teacher instructed and he told us which room to go, mind you, I thought he was taking us to the locker room to get changed, but instead, he took us to a room in the basement of the school, when we three entered the room, it was cold, dark, and empty, our teacher had already left and closed the door, the room had only 1 lightbulb and it was broken too, so it only lit up half of the room, the rest was completely pitch black, it wasn’t the dark that scared me, it was the painting in the middle of the room, it didn’t look like it belonged there, it was a painting of a man, the background was completely white and the man looked like a shadow, I couldn’t see any of his features, except his eyes, they were way too realistic, they looked like the eyes of the man in the painting had been cut out and replaced with real eyes, I swear I saw the eyes move, and I even heard breathing too, but it didn’t really sound like a child’s breathing, if that makes any sense, but I decided to ignore it anyways, and then a few days after that, he started coming in the room with us, in excuse of “helping us change our clothes”, and that’s where the ‘R’ started happening, he would touch me in places that should not be touched while making my two poor classmates watch what he was doing to me, I didn’t understand what he was doing or why he was doing that, I was just a child, I didn’t understand why he chose to only “teach” me, (or thats what he called it), but not my classmates too, then the touches escalated to him taking his thing out and rubbing it against places that should not be touched, and after he’s done, he would beat me up in places that aren’t visible and threaten to kill me if I said anything, so ofc I didn’t say a word to anyone, and till this day, no one knows anything, and he kept ‘R’ ing me for 3 years straight, my classmates left after one year in the swimming lessons, I don’t know anything about them anymore, but good for them that they were able to leave and I hope they’re doing well out there.

My mother noticed that there was something wrong with me because I cried every time she takes me to my swimming lessons but she thought I was being spoiled or dramatic, but eventually, I left, just after 3 fucking years, but anyway, even though I left and I hope to never see him again, I left with A LOT of trauma, a lot, I can’t be in a dark room alone, I have nightmares of that painting practically everyday, just everything reminds me of him, bite marks, dark rooms, paintings, pools, even fucking lightbulbs, I don’t know what to fucking do anymore. I can remember every fucking detail even the thing he’s named after, except his face.

i hate that my natural mode is to be optimistic, i keep trying to find value in it but it just makes everything just hurt so much more.
i try to find worth in living through getting outdoor jobs and spending a lot of time outside, but what the fuck is the point? i love being outside but i’m just biding my time until i die, i don’t feel like i can actually change anything about the world or have any kind of impact so i just choose to be selfish and fuck around outside. all of my hobbies and the things i do to occupy my time are just distractions from the desire to kill myself, and they don’t mean anything at the end of the day.


i’ve thought about different modes of suicide for such a long time, and i’ve ultimately decided that it needs to look like an accident for the sake of not hurting my family as much. i was driving last night at 2am on these empty fucking rural mountain roads and i wanted to drive off the side and crash down, but i’m a coward and thought about the possibility of a slow death or permanently disabling myself or going into a coma or some stupid shit. so then i was thinking maybe i could be driving, go towards the edge, then shoot myself, but that obviously wouldn’t look like an accident. so then i started thinking about how it being “accidental” would fuck my family up regardless, so i feel like i can’t kill myself until they die. i feel incredibly selfish and just evil for thinking about that in terms of their deaths, like the loss of my family obviously isn’t anything to look forward to, but at least if i waited then i wouldn’t be a source of emotional burden or trauma to them while they’re alive. i wish they didn’t love me or care about me. 


i honestly don’t know if i can last that long but i know i don’t want to last that long, ive always thought i would die before im 30 not because of health or anything, but i just don’t want to be alive. i hate that i have a sister too, because then that means i’m going to have to wait even longer. i just don’t want to wait and i feel so fucking stuck and like i’m forced to be alive, im going to therapy and taking medications consistently but just like my hobbies and going to school, it’s all just biding my time and trying to cope with being alive when all i want is to die.


i don’t think ill ever get better, and i guess i keep wanting relationships where its equal and reciprocated because at least i can make someone else feel loved and happy (and that’s basically all i want for other people) but apparently the only solution for me is to constantly distance myself so im not the one getting hurt.

i felt i was doing pretty good lately so i gradually came off my meds in january - it was a low dose (10 mg prozac) and for a long time i felt i didnt need the meds anymore. they really acted as a mood stabilizer for me and prevented agitation, but lately, with a bunch of confusing and kinda difficult recent events and the feeling of being lonely had made my depression much worse and i was having harmful thoughts again so before it got too bad i started my meds again.

i did realize though, that i think literally just a couple days into ramadan my bad thoughts became aggravated and even though i wasnt fasting the first week, i think the fact that i was having dinner much later, avoiding eating around fasting family members, and having a terrible sleep schedule, made things much worse. i love ramadan and understand its a very important month for spirituality but i realize for the past three ramadans at least, even when the season was warm and sunny, my depression has been the worst. i think knowing that my drastic change in routine may be an issue, is super helpful because i used to think there is something wrong with me and im a bad muslim so i avoided getting into my faith, but knowing that i need to focus on my routine and its ok for me to take meds and stuff is really helping. i feel like i have both an understanding of my situation, and the tools i need to address it. its liberating in a sense, to know that im not a bad person, and there are steps i can take to try my best to get the most out of this time that is important to me.

im already noticing a big difference - of course my meds are helping a lot i think (they work pretty quick for me), but even just accepting that a change in routine is ok, and figuring out how i can manage my time to get the most sleep, nutrition, and activity i need to stay mentally healthy, is providing me the energy i need to take opportunities to connect to my faith.

of course, the impact i experienced may not apply to everyone and i understand that everyones struggle is different. i guess im just glad that i had this win to be honest and figured out this big mystery ive had for the past few years. and if sharing my experience and analysis/reflection does help anyone else, then that would be great"

And on the other I wanna just do bare minimum and spare any mental drain. When I go I’m exhausted and do nothing but wait for the day to end. I have no friends, I have nothing to look forward to, and I just wanna go home and lay down. On the other hand I stay home and feel guilty all day, even anxious that my teachers will be upset or yell at me for missing classes so there’s no way of winning. I just wanna give up entirely, I don’t know how to handle this at all. I know it’s important for my future but I just don’t have much to give, I can’t stop missing it’s a habit that’s ingrained into me, I feel hopeless and like I’m destined to fail or end up with a horrible GPA. Everything is draining, everything stresses me out, I feel like I have too much responsibility and I don’t see it getting better. "

Hi, I’m A, I’ve talked about what happened to me when I was 6 in another post, if you wanna read it, you can check my profile, but it’s a little bit disturbing.


I’ll get right into it, I can’t get him out of my mind, even though I left my old school, I feel like he’s still there with me, when I forget to turn a lightbulb on and I’m completely in the dark, it makes me remember the dark room I was in, and I’d feel him in the room with me, I could smell his scent, or hear him breathing and laughing, especially laughing, and I can see his figure, he looks like a shadow, it’s like he’s in front of me, watching me, or waiting for me to move, and when these things happen, my body just literally freezes, I cant move, I cant speak, even breathing gets hard, I literally stay in my bed till morning comes or till one of my family members open the door to get something from my room, but other than that, I stay frozen in place, staring at him and him staring at me and laughing, I’m scared to move, whenever I moved when I was young and he didn’t allow me to move, he would kick me in places that should not be kicked in. 

When I was 6, he used to bite my arm to get me to jump into the water since he was my swimming teacher, and now, I formed the habit of biting my arm really hard to the point of bleeding when I’m stressed or don’t wanna do something, and when I look at my arm after I bitten it, I remember everything, it flashes like a movie before my eyes


And I cant look at any painting the same anymore, I cant, in the dark room I was in, there was a painting in the middle of the room, the man n the painting looked like a silhouette of someone or a shadow of someone, but the eyes didn’t look like they matched at fucking all, the eyes of the man in the painting looked like they were cut out and replaced with his eyes, I swear. It was too dark for me to see, I could’ve sworn I saw them blink or fucking move. Whenever I look at a painting, the eyes turn into the eyes I saw in the painting, I know it’s an just my imagination, but I have nightmares of that painting every fucking day

Everything fucking reminds me of him, everything, swimming pools, bite marks, broken light bulbs, dark rooms, paintings. I just cant fucking take it anymore, I don’t want to see him every time I close my eyes, I don’t want to

When i close my eyes for even just a second, a image of a man appears, I can see his features, but I can’t see them, idk how to explain it, and whenever I try to focus on seeing his features my brain starts hurting and I start to shiver, he looks like he’s bending down and smiling at me, it’s the same posture he used to do after he was done with me

Most of my days consist of waking up and binge gaming to try and ignore what im feeling. My dad died when i was 10 and ever since then all the days mush together and my sensee of time has been warped. I also feel like thats the root of all this heartache and confusion Im feeling. I have hardly any friends both male and female. And any time a female does show me any attention i become attached immediately and i wish it wasnt that way. I just feel like loosing my dad so early stunted my development and i still feel like a kid when im a full ass adult. Trauma is really weird. My mom was also emotionally absent and i was left to deal with all these feelings myself until it got so bad i threatened suicide then it was whatever prescription the dr recommended. I love my mom but sometimes it feels like she could care less about me until it starts affecting her. I see all these kids that graduated with me going into their careers and finding love and starting families and i feel so lost and dont know where i would even start trying to find a career. Im really tired of feeling like this i dont want to die but i dont see the purpose in living.

It's a 2 floor call center. And I can get most of my work done in under 5 hours. Lately I'll admit, my depression has been really bad. So bad that all I've done in the past 2 weeks is the bare minimum work (clean bathrooms, empty trashcans, vacuum up crumbs under cubicles). Do I need to do more than that? Absolutely. But my depression has just been so bad that I have no energy to do much of anything. When my depression acts up at work I go and sit in my car for hours on end and just stare blankly out the window or cry. Well yesterday my supervisor came in for his weekly check ups (to make sure your keeping up with everything and doing everything correctly). Well he wasn't happy with my dusting, my lack of mopping, and not detail vacuuming. So after he left my manager came in and looked around. She also was not happy and warned me to shape up or I'll get fired and thought I was just being lazy. I had to fill out some paperwork stating why I was getting written up and that this was my only warning, and blah blah blah. I didn't explain to my manager that I have depression and that it's been acting up. Because I don't like to tell jobs I have depression because I feel like they'll only think it's an excuse. And I'm really not looking for sympathy either. I am doing counseling with my therapist and am on medication and he recently upped my dosage. But I still feel depressed most days. The only time I can say I am even remotely content is when I am at home with my dog and 2 cats. I don't hate my job either. I chose this job because I also have anxiety. And working retail or doing customer service in general just gets me to overworked and anxious. This job is very chill (most of the time, now when the call center has holiday parties, it's not chill it's very much a lot of work to do and clean up).

For most of our relationship, we have been able to communicate well and consistently. Since late last year, he’s gone through some changes with work and school so I think the stresses of trying to manage them has gotten to him. When he’s felt depressed in the past, he’s gone quiet for a bit, but always reached out to me after a few days. This time it’s different. He’s shared with me that he feels things are getting worse, he has no motivation, basically going through the motions. When things are really bad, he said he can get into

Now, I could be seen as a crazy ex, but I still genuinely love and care about my ex, although her behavior is weird. I first noticed something a month ago: my ex started talking to me less and became more distant. At first, I thought it was because she was about to have her period, as she usually becomes more distant the week before. So, I thought nothing of it. Turns out, it was. She had her period, and she wasn’t as loving and clingy as she usually is. Over the next couple of weeks, this behavior continued, and then she broke up with me. The signs were all there of her falling out of love, so I didn’t think much about it. She ended up getting back with me, but over the course of the next week, she became really distant. We ended up breaking up for good. After the breakup, she was abnormally cold and told me she feels numb. Now, this is where I asked her if it’s just towards me or everything, and she said everything. At first, I didn’t believe her and just thought she fell out of love like couples do, but I texted one of her best friends, and he told me that she was making him mad too because she was also really distant and cold to him. Now, as I think about it, the way she went from being seriously in love with me to just not caring was really quick and sudden, and she also randomly texts me “I love you.” I’m just concerned and wondering if anyone has any insight on what could be going on."

Starting from a terrible childhood to becoming too self conscious to even look people in the eye, never had friends or close family to relate to, rotting/missing teeth, covered in scars + nerve damage, destroyed my body health wise and physically, dropped out of college (but the degree I was ""passionate"" on is worthless in the real world so getting it would have also been a waste), the list goes on and on.

 I feel like such a failure, it feels like whatever I do I will still be miserable in the end. Which is probably the case. I don't want to even bother trying anymore. I want to dissappear.

One could argue that since I'm still on the younger side I can turn my life around and get that happy ending but I don't believe in that. Everytime I tried it was squandered one way or another. And, I genuinely don't understand people want to live. I envy them, actually. I wish I also had whatever magic they do to enjoy continuing in this hellhole.

The future and present feels daunting, I wish I could grab my belongings in a big sack, and just run away to a quiet corner of the world, and just live out the rest of my days. But I need money for that, and for money I need a job, which needs a degree, which leads me back here. I have no choice but to buckle down, and just go forward, but it feels very daunting at times, despite my friend and families support. I wish I could fully see in myself what they see in me, but the feeling comes and goes.

 May God bless you all, and help you in your hardships.

I lose my zest for life every day, I try to start something new and get interested, but it just doesn't work

I try not to let anyone feel it, I'm friendly to everyone, I laugh, I talk, but when I'm alone I feel so empty

After returning home from work, my only thought is that I have not done anything in my life, I can't achieve anything and that I am just wasting my time

I'm not a failure and I don't lack friends, but I feel like there's a lot of chaos in my life and nothing is real around me

I have many goals in life and I work hard to achieve them, but there are times when these thoughts bother me so much that I can only lie down and do nothing else

Also I'm already pretty sure I have ADHD based on the symptoms, which is even more pressure for me, and again, I can't talk to anyone about it

People think that I don't care about them and only think about myself, but no, I'm just stuck in a void and I don't know what to do

These thoughts are getting stronger and more difficult for me to deal with them, I can't find a way out and I don't know what's next anymore

I've tried everything, I'm working, training, reading, playing video games, but when I'm alone or when I'm about to sleep, nothing can help me and these thoughts keep coming back

I don't know if it's depression or just stupid thoughts, but something is eating me inside that I can't fight

I can't talk about all this with anyone, I think no one will take me seriously and I'd rather use a fake smile with them again

I don't know what to do and I just go on with my life, but I realize that I can't last like that much longer

I’m barely sleeping, I can’t remember the last time I drank water, I’m just surviving at the minute, it’s a horrible feeling. I’ve had the last week off work as I physically couldn’t pull myself out the rut I was in every morning and even putting my socks on getting out of bed would send me into a spiral of guilt and anxiety. I went in yesterday and I did a good job at staying the whole day, but had a crying episode halfway through the day infront of everyone because a child hit me, I’m embarrassed, I feel useless, and I’m fed up of everything, my therapist wants me to call the doctors to change my antidepressants but if I’m honest I can’t be bothered, ugh honestly I’m stopping myself it’s so hard to get out of this mindset.

The problem is that when I am experiencing depression, my natural ability to give people the benefit of the doubt decreases substantially.  Logically, I know that most people are still neutral.  Emotionally, retaining that neutral feeling becomes a huge uphill battle.  I can come away from an interation having the full awareness that, at any other time, it would have seemed neutral, but during depressive episodes, it just *feels so bad*.  This is the illogical nature of depression on display.    


As someone who is usually able to control his emotions fairly well, this is always super frustrating.  I have come away from some very neutral conversations today feeling unwarranted things like fear and extreme sadness.  I even have thought about going to the bathroom to cry.

He told my mom to kill herself, that shes a terrible mother etc. and she always calls him every night asking about his day. I live with her and she never asks me. She doesn’t grocery shop for me because im 16 while she cooks for my brother who still lives with my dad and personally delivers the food to him. 

im completely unmotivated to do anything, but i still always help out around the house for me mom so she doesnt feel like im being lazy. i do the dishes, the laundry, i clean the house, i make her tea whenever shes feeling down and im really trying to be a good daughter. Im doing everything i can. 

I want to get a job since im doing so terrible in school. But i dont even have a card because my mom always complains “what do you need it for?” and then complains i dont have a job. I dont get an allowance, whereas when my brother was 16 parents taught him everything, they got him a job, everything he needed to get him started. Even though he has a job, parents still give him money whenever he needs it. 

To add to all that, my brother has been sexually assaulting me whenever im near since i was 9. He did it infront of his friends to the point they started doing it to me. I ended up telling my parents when i was 14 and they completely ignored it. They took his side. 

im so lost, i dont know what i have done. they gave all these opportunities to my brother and i was just a cleaner to them that they would feed. 

My brother dropped out first semester of college and parents were completely fine with it. He has such an easy life, everything was hand fed to him. Our mom felt bad because he didnt get a birthday cake for him 19th birthday while i havent been getting anything for my birthday expect a sleepover 

This year, i spent my birthday away from home, My mom was on a vacation in turkey with her friends, my dad was working. I didnt even get a phone call from either of them. its was my 16th birthday. the only call i got was from my cousin that i havent talked to since 2015.

They're doing fun things, having friends and relationships, they have normal problems. I was weak all my life and was told time and time again to kill myself. I am being literally tortured by my family and I'm just not having fun in life. The only reason I've stayed alive all this time was simply because there are some things in life I wanna do but it'll be a while until I'll be able to do those things... I wanna cry but I can't.

i was screaming crying today to my mum because i do not feel heard. still she shut me down. i cried “ is am telling you now in this moment i am not okay“ all she replied was “i know your screaming” not comforting me not reassuring me just making me feel unseen and unheard. i then went upstairs to sh as it’s the only escape for me. i am desperate for medication for my anxiety and depression but chams and there fucked up sistem have some really stupid rules and waiting lists wich is holding me back from the one thing that could make me happy and feel normal. medication, it’s like my mental health is veiwed as a joke and everyone thinks im not being serious. but i am being dead fucking serious i am not okay and i am hanging on by a tread i feel unseen and small and i want my mind to be quie. i want to live in peace "

1biprmt,insautumnnia,4,1.0,1710868931,depression,"Two bilateral injuries took away my happiness I’m 24 years old and have been lifting seriously for a year and a half. 
I loved the physical and mental feeling from lifting, I felt the happiest and most energized I ever have in my life. I loved being strong. But I know I took it too far. 
I progressively overloaded too fast and one day my hips began to hurt doing BSS. Then my wrists from bench press. So I bought wrist wraps and kept going, not knowing that it was reinforcing bad recruitment patterns and weakness I already had in my wrists. 
I couldn’t emotionally handle not being able to lift, so I tried to back off the weight but didn’t stop lifting. 
After 6 months of that I hit a breaking point. I can’t work out with either wrist or either hip. I suspect I have Dequervain’s, lateral & medial wrist tendonopathy, and hip problems like bursitis, FAI, hip flexor, or labrum tear.
I can’t get insurance through my job and my parents insurance deductible is thousands of dollars so I will have to pay for any treatment myself. I don’t see myself being able to get medical treatment because I don’t make enough to pay for it. I already struggle with living expenses. 
I work from home and used to sit at a desk. Now I lay in bed because I can’t sit down to work without the hip pain. I’m slow and lousy working in my bed but it’s all I can do. 
I can barely squat down, can’t stand for long, my hips ache when I do almost anything, and my wrists are even more far gone. It hurts to pick up a cup of coffee, brush my teeth, buckle my seatbelt, and work on my computer. 
I haven’t lifted in over a month now. I’ve backed off, increased my protein intake, only do movements that don’t irritate the injuries, and tried mobility/stability exercises at home. The mobility movements even cause pain. 
I’m living with upper and lower body bilateral injuries, so I can’t do anything I was doing at the gym, not even scaled back. Even driving with wrist and hip pain is difficult. 
I know that I did this to myself and it’s a hard lesson to learn. But I’m working from bed, experiencing pain, don’t have the money for assessment/treatment, and I just feel numb every day. 
I suppose I don’t need advice (especially the “It’s a bad day not a bad life” advice). I know I have a long ways to go. I know that poor recruitment patterns take a long time to unlearn. But I just don’t have hope anymore. 
I just want to know if anyone’s experienced an injury that affects their entire body’s ability to do everything. Not just one part of the body. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t enjoy anything and can’t do anything.
I just feel numb."
1biv7z9,Odd-Entrepreneur3236,2,5.0,1710882136,depression,"Je ne supporte plus mon amie dépressive Je sais que ce titre peut paraître horriblement odieux, mais j’ai besoin d’expulser tout ce que j’ai sur le cœur car je n’arrive pas à prendre de décisions.

Nous sommes amies depuis une douzaine d’années, on s’est rencontré en première année de fac. On a été très bonnes amies, on a partagé beaucoup de problèmes (TCA), et j’ai appris à l’époque qu’elle avait des traumas d’enfance particulièrement violents. 
Plus tard, on s’est perdu de vue puis retrouvé pour être à nouveau bonnes amies, même meilleures amies. Tout allait bien. 

Arrive le jour où nous sommes colocataires, et je décide quelques mois plus tard d’y mettre fin et d’aller vivre chez mon chéri car la vie avec elle devenait beaucoup trop dure à supporter pour moi: elle allait particulièrement mal mentalement, en partie à cause de problèmes professionnels, mais également à cause d’un état dépressif lié à son passé.
J’ai également soupçonné des sentiments amoureux à mon égard, et une grosse jalousie envers mon amoureux et mes autres amis, car même si je passais peu de temps avec lui ou eux, elle se refermait et me faisait la gueule quand c’était le cas. 
J’ai tenu le temps que j’ai pu mais je ne supportais plus d’être sans arrêt sollicitée pour ses états d’âme, ses problèmes profonds, sa négativité permanente. Sa simple aura me rendait mal à l’aise et me stressait énormément. 

Je me suis donc éloignée quelques temps quand j’ai déménagé, et la plupart des copains en communs que nous avions me disait qu’il fallait peut-être même couper les ponts, car apparemment, elle me critiquait énormément dans mon dos. Beaucoup ont essayé de me dire que cette amitié était toxique. Beaucoup ont arrêté de lui parler. Je suis la seule maintenant.

Je ne compte même plus le nombre de rendez-vous avec elle que j’ai subi juste pour qu’elle ne soit pas seule, alors que je voulais juste m’échapper.
Parfois ça va mieux, (elle a même enfin pris rendez-vous chez un psy, elle a une chérie (relation à distance), elle a changé de travail…), et parfois elle va mal et j’ai l’impression que tout le malheur du monde, c’est de ma faute.
Et là malheureusement, depuis quelques semaines, c’est encore pire. Je ressens tout le temps de culpabilité auprès d’elle, j’ai l’impression de ne jamais en faire assez à ses yeux, et ça me fatigue tellement que je ne peux plus la voir. 
Le peu de fois où on se voit, elle ne fait que se plaindre, dire qu’elle va mal, que je ne l’ai pas aidé. Pas une seule fois elle ne m’a demandé de mes nouvelles ou comment j’allais.
Recevoir un message de sa part, ou savoir qu’elle est passée à mon boulot quand j’étais absente me met mal à l’aise. Je suis clairement à bout, et j’ai l’impression qu’il est temps pour moi de rompre cette amitié. Mais si je fais ça, elle n’aura plus personne.

Que dois-je faire?

1bj0nev,blessedminx,1,0.0,1710895583,depression,"Sick and tired Not sure if it's depression. No diagnosis but damnnn..I hate living! I barely even see the point these days. It's same old thing everyday, going through the motions, with a sprinkle of dread upon wakening. When i try to level up something happens and i eventually give up. I feel cursed. I feel no joy, have zero ambition, I feel alone in the world. I almost have nothing. All i have are my beautiful, yet challenging daughters, who are the only reason i get up everyday and even then, I wonder why i ever thought it a good idea to bring them into this calous world. They have no idea yet what living means. Maybe they won't be like me and will love life, I hope they do!  But I can not, I have tried all my life. I never fit in anywhere. People have just used me for their their own benefit. Nothing good ever lasts for me. 

I used to be quite bubbly, outgoing. I had skills, I could sketch and draw and write. I enjoyed life and appreciated nature and  people. Now, i find it hard to see beauty in anything. It's as if i have regressed..?

There's no point trying to get a diagnosis or therapy because I have no money or time for it. I take care of my kids solo and when i can i help my Nan who has dementia and my Mom who has cancer. It is so draining though. Any free time i do get i just want to sleep. I lovee sleep and wish i could fall asleep and never wake up again.

No one likes me anymore and i dont blame them. I give off those miserable negative vibes. I am giving up on even trying to be likable. I don't even like other people anymore. I see them all as fake because the ones I did trust always Hurt me. Never ending memories of being the butt of jokes, the invisble one (Still), taken advantage of, abused. Some think i am naive or inexperienced lool, but I am the complete opposite. Iv'e been through so much fuckery and carry that trauma but even loved ones don't resonate with me.

People are always saying it's scientifically proven that sunlight will boost your mood, but for me, sunlight actually makes my mood so bad that I feel worse than before. I have vision issues, so sunlight gives me a headache. I have eczema, so going out in the sun burns me and gives me rashes even with sun block. Additionally, I have a heart disorder and can't breathe in the heat, but I also have allergies so I can't go out in the spring. Then, for some reason, the thought of the sub still being visible at 9pm makes me more depressed. I probably feel more depressed in the summer, but even in the winter, I don't go out if it's sunny. Sometimes I'll go out or open my curtains if it's cloudy. Every day feels calmer and less overwhelming to me the darker it is. And if I ever need light, I have led wall lights that aren't too overwhelmingly bright, and I can adjust their brightness, unlike the sun. But, I wouldn't mind if somebody turned the sun off. That shit too bright. I tend to hibernate when it's out."

When you've been holding all those feelings in for so long nothing feels right anymore. Then it all hits you at once , hopelessness hitting hard , feeling you'll never be able to get out of here .
Drowning your self in social media , in bed , at night , seeing how everyone has better lives than you doing more in a day than you could ever in a year, all because you can't get up , what's the point . If you just complete the bare minimum:
Wake up .check
Brush teeth. Check 
Shower. Not today
Go to work . Check 
Come home . Check 
Finish up a bit of work. Later 
Sleep and get ready to do it all over again . Check 
People are so tiring why can't everyone just stay quiet , not be too nosy , hands to themselves, stop seeking attention and get on with what they were supposed to be doing and JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
When you're at the lowest you've ever been and just stuck there like a flat line on one of those heart rate moniter thingys .
Ready to leave this world , no suicide, it only adds to the pain you feel .
""Life's short"" , "" life's tough"" , "" some things aren't meant for everyone"" 
Trying to cry? No , not a single tear, eyes so dry from last night , sobbing without the salty moistness on your face .
Outside is just as cold as your heart , spring's here liven up why don't you?
Fine. Just put that mask on everytime you go out, thicker than your foundation or concealer, bronzer or blush .
Full coverage , and when you get home, wipe it off .
Small things happen , but when you're at that point where you can't take anymore , it makes you burst , fire roaring in you ears, face hot ,feeling the strength in your arms and jaws , then realising you hurt someone.
It gets better. Right?

He's been on depression meds almost all of our relationship together and it has had enormous effects on our sex life. He is not able to get a full erection - often barely a semi. About 5 years ago, I was going to leave him as we had a lot of issues (sex was certainly one of the bigger ones, but there were also trust and control issues), but I stayed around because he proactively shared that he was going to try to get help. Here we are five years later and he's tried pumps, pills, soundwave therapy and says he's willing to try some kind of injections. Sounds painful. I'm at a point right now where I feel like I've been patient and understanding, but I don't see the situation improving.

I am severely depressed and i see a dead end at the end of the tunnel. The thing is, i am 27, i am accomplished in my career, i am pursuing my master degree on scholarship, i have a lot of money for someone my age, i have been regarded as a physically attractive girl, i have two loving parents, i have travelled a lot, i have many friends who love me, but the failure of relationship and the prospect of dying alone haunt me so much.

I have had 3 past boyfriends, i became close to someone last year and it failed. After each failure, i think of how far i am on the prospect of having a family. The hard truth is, i really want to get married and have a child, but i seem to fail. I thought i am the toxic and the bad one always but i have lowered the standard for some aspect but can't seem to work out. Now i am talking to no one and i feel lonely eventhough i feel surrounded by people. I got diagnosed with depression on January and i am on medication, but i know this is just a temporary fix. The horrifying thought continue to haunt me, to the point that i am doing self-harm and have suicidal thought at times like this:

1. I know my friend's boyfriend is visiting and after 5 minutes of knowing that news, i had to go to my room because i had a major panic attack and i did try to hurt myself
2. One of my closest friend is getting engaged in february, she sent me the picture, i replied with how happy i am, but that picture alone sent me overboard and i did not go out for 3 days out of my room, barely eating and doing self harm again

I can't seem to use dating app anymore because it makes me so anxious, i run to self-sabotage. And i am tired when my parents point out how accomplished i am in every area of my life but when i look back it's so sad i have no one to celebrate my good moments with as my friends settle down and have their own significant other.

I just need someone to listen and have some type of human connection to stop my dark thoughts. I am so alone in everything I am dealing with and healing generational trauma while trying to be a good parent to my 8 month old daughter. I feel like every time I try to breathe something pushes me back under the water. I have had a very hard life. My parents were in and out of my life as they pleased, separating me and my siblings just to hand us off to whoever would take us whether it be aunts or grandmas. When I lived with my grandmother I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. I tried to tell my family what was happening and they didn’t believe me or just didn’t want to deal with it and shipped me off to my grandparents on my dads side of the family. The only way I can describe what this event makes me feel like is- dirty. I’ve felt dirty since it happened when I was around 10 years of age. And often times questioned whether it really happened, but I still wake often to nightmares to remind myself it was true and to not accept being gaslighted because it’s an uncomfortable situation to deal with. I legally emancipated parents and was living with a friend and her family. Her mom was in my eyes a hero, until the checks stopped coming in for her “taking care” of me. Everything quickly turned into a nightmare, physical and emotion violence became a normal everyday thing. I can still vividly hear her screams and things slamming while begging her to stop. My safe haven was crumbling. She put a lot of pressure on me and her kids because she had a rough upbringing as well. Instead of learning from her trauma she thought it was only fair we had a hard time too. She became a textbook narcissist- everything was about what she needed emotionally and would often confide in me her marital issues, I had to clean the house and pick her kids up basically became Cinderella. She was also doing a lot of cocaine which made her outbursts inevitable every single day. My boyfriend had seen what I was going through and moved me into to his parents immediately. Ten years later we are engaged with our beautiful daughter. I’m supposed to be my happiest now that I’m out of harms way and have everything I could ever want, but I feel so empty and broken inside which makes me feel so guilty. My thoughts are constantly consumed with what everyone around me needs, what I need to fix within myself, whether or not I’m a good mom. I feel like my feelings and thoughts aren’t even mine anymore. And I don’t want to feel this broken. I’m angry, resentful, scared and exhausted. I worry every second that If I’m not perfect all the time that I will fuck my daughter up like how life did to me. I can’t eat or sleep and having panic attacks where I can’t move my hands, they get stuck like crab claws. I don’t have resources or time for a therapist.  Please anyone just talk to me there is so much I left out I just need to talk to someone. I don’t want to bother my parent anymore with this he’s going through so much right now as well. Please someone talk to me.

I know it's hard but just for a moment, put all problems aside. Stop running scenarios and memories.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"". Repeat. 

STOP. Just freeze. Your mind and your body. Look around and find no current and immediate threat to your life.

Slow your breath, breathe a bit deeper because a brain without oxygen doesn't do much rationalizing, only panicking. Fuller, slower breathes. Don’t stop. 

Relax your tense muscles. You're in fight or flight, your body is geared up. We're ""un-gearing"" it.

Find something in every color of the rainbow. Red.
Orange. Yellow. Etc..

Feel your feet on the floor. Really pay attention to them. Feel the floor, grass, shoes.

""I am here. I am now. I am safe"".



Live in the immediate present moment as much as you can. The past is f’d up, it's not safe there. The future seems insurmountable, uncertain, like you're only ever going to feel the way you do right now (which isn't true!!!). And how are we supposed to live if it's always that way. The future is filled with too many variables and uncertainties, it's not safe either. (You can worry about the future when you are finally stable and come out on the other side of this shit show.)
One day at a time can be way too much sometimes.
Focus on the RIGHT NOW. Focus on calming your body and your mind will eventually follow. 
Even if that's all you do, all day every day. THAT'S OKAY!!! We hold ourselves to the highest expectation and we need to learn to give ourselves some grace during our healing journey. You've been through some traumatizing shit, I'm sure. This is how your mind and body survived. You're here now. And you're safe. And you will get through it. Just take care of your body the best you can. Try to love it even when you hate it. And the same thing goes for your mind."

Ive felt what i think is derealization, and I just dont even feel real 80% of my day and i think this is most likely from me smoking. I dont know if i believe in god anymore after this either, as this wasnt something that was deserved but I know people say god does stuff like this still. Id like to believe in god again as that gave me alot of motivation too, but its so hard to try to believe in him again after this
Id like to get back into my old motivation but I just dont know where to start it. I never experienced a loss that has been this close to me, me and him spent all day everyday together. Any advice for this?

1birr2g,Ok_Act_2424247249874,2,0.0,1710873775,depression,"Tired of feeling alone, but I'm afraid it's going to keep getting worse I fucked up my marriage a year and a half ago.  My wife and I were married 6 years, worked at the same company (how we met), until she decided to stay home with our kids around August 2022.  A few months later, I came home from work and told her about my day, which consisted of working on an emerging issue.  It was complicated to test, because it required using a special test rig and a temperature chamber, so I worked with the rig responsible (a female) .

Being that my wife and I used to work together, work was a common discussion for us.  I was so excited to tell her about this new problem, so I told her when I got home.  She replied with ""when did you start having feelings for coworker?""  I was and am still baffled.  I don't know how or why that was the conclusion she jumped to.  I don't and didn't have feelings for this coworker.  The problem is that the issue didn't stop there.  She continued to push the issue, never asking questions, always making accusations.  The accusations turned into arguments, because I wasn't admitting to what she 'knew' to be true.  The arguments led to yelling, cursing, and her telling me that if I wouldn't admit to this, that our marriage clearly wasn't important to me, and she would leave me.

So I told myself that if she needed me to be a bastard, so that we could work through this 'issue' and come out the other side, that I would do it.  So I lied and told her that it was true, and that I had feelings.  I've been talking with therapists about this and other issues, mostly about my childhood and how my father was a bully.  My father bullied me my whole childhood, I didn't get to talk and have a voice, I wasn't viewed as a person, and I learned to say or do whatever was needed to not make things worse.  I wish to god I had gone to therapy years ago and learned this about myself, but I didn't.  My wife is a very strong personality, which she learned from her mother.  She is also older than me.  I learned to just give in and let her lead.  So I lived this lie hoping that we could work through it and go back to 'normal' afterwards.  But she continued to make accusations that were unfounded, and the process repeated.  Her badgering me about what she 'knew' I thought, me not admitting to it, badgering continues, I relent.

I tried multiple times to tell her what I did, but she refuses to accept it.  She doesn't want to listen to me, she can't trust what I say.  I did this to myself because I don't know how to handle adversity and have difficult conversations.  I'm learning now, but it's too late.  I love her with everything in my being, and she resents me.  When I get home from work she's cold and distant, because she 'knows' that I've been looking at other girls, thinking about having sex with them, thinking about being in relationships with them.  I can't handle it anymore.  I have literally one in-person friend, and I don't feel like I can discuss this with him because I was shitty and distant while he was suffering through his own divorce years ago.  I don't have an escape, we live with her parents and her sister.  The only thing keeping me alive right now is our kids.

I know its my fault, I'm not trying to remove blame.  It just hurts so fucking much.  I gave everything to the relationship that I could and it wasn't enough.  It wasn't enough to keep her from thinking that I was straying, she was so sure.  I'm not enough as a person to keep someone happy, no matter how much I give.  We moved away from my family to be close to hers (across the street), when that house had water damage, we moved into her parents house, who also had her sister, husband, and 2 kids living in it.  We lived with them for a year while my wife and her sister fought like children and made everything so uncomfortable.  I made dinner for 10 people twice a week (at least) for the better part of a year.  I fixed up their house, I agreed to using my work vacation time to take vacations with her family twice a year, I am there for my kids, I worked in every way I could to show love to her and her family, and she still hates me.  I am nothing and I have nothing and I don't deserve to be a person."

1bimysw,ThrowRAsistertroubl,3,1.0,1710862138,depression,"I can't cope with stress Hi there,

This is my first time posting. I have major depressive disorder, co-occurring with generalized anxiety, and cPTSD. 

At work, I have contacted the disability coordinator, and I have spoken with HR. My symptoms are very severe and I am on medications, in therapy, and I am in the process of TMS therapy.

Sometimes I forget things. I experience bad brain fog. I will have random panic attacks, or if I forget to take my antidepressant, I can't remember anything from the day before, and I feel like I've been hit by a truck.

Troubles aside, I have been a good employee. I get all of my work done every day. I have been so good and reliable that I have been assigned MORE work. For context, I am a legal assistant. I am a new employee and have been employed for four months, so sometimes I forget a step or make a mistake. Since I am a legal assistant, it's usually inconsequential, and fixable. However, my boss CONSTANTLY criticizes me. It's so bad I have panic attacks nearly daily.

She is aware of my situation. Disability services and HR have talked with her at length and my therapist has even written documentation with suggestions on how to speak with me and clarify issues. It's almost as if she just ignored them completely. She vacillates between praising me for my work ethic and ability, and criticizing me for the smallest thing (forgetting to enter time, WHICH WE CAN'T EVEN BILL SINCE WE ARE LAs) or forgetting to cc someone on an email.

I always gracefully take responsibility for anything that happens, and take steps to mitigate it in the future. Today I am at my limit. Yesterday I was swamped with my work, and everyone else's. I worked intensely until the end of the day. Throughout that day, I was receiving constant emails from her criticizing me. I ignored it on account of being entirely too busy for her bullshit. 

This morning, I logged on to work and the first thing I see is another email about entering a time slip. This time, for days I was physically sick. I hit my limit. I'm not sure if this person is being purposefully obtuse or if she is just an idiot. I am so angry, and I am so overwhelmed. 

On top of that, I forgot my antidepressant yesterday so I had vivid nightmares, I can't remember anything about yesterday after work, and I feel like I have been run over. I have absolutely hit my limit. I don't know what to do anymore.

I don't know if I should contact Disability again. I have been looking for new jobs but with no luck. I do not want to talk to her at all and I shouldn't be forced to. I am on the verge of another panic attack. I don't know how to cope and I feel frozen to the spot. 

Any advice would be appreciated, but thank you for letting me vent."

Want to add on? -**Ask that my partner fully opens the bedroom curtains when he leaves for work every morning while I'm still in bed.** It means I get natural light exposure first thing in the morning which improves depression, circadian rhythm, and may help me in getting out of bed. This one is so lazy it doesn't even require me doing anything, it's just my partner lol.

-**Remove the junkfood from it's current, super-convenient location in the kitchen where I keep automatically reaching for it multiple times a day and put it somewhere less immediately accessible and tempting. Also put healthier foods in their most convenient place possible.** Like baby carrots in door of the fridge, and chocolate snacks on the bottom shelf halfway back. Some bananas on my side table, whatever. Utilize my laziness so that I might eat the banana next to me rather than go retrieve the cookies haha. Also, place a frozen bottle of water on my nightstand at bedtime so in the morning I can wake up and sip some cool water to start my day on a nice note.

-**Take ""phone walks"" around the house.** I sadly spend a lot of my time online and on my phone. I don't have the willpower to kick that habit yet, but in the meantime I don't mind occasionally walking a mindless circuit around inside my house while I'm on my phone. If I was to get too dizzy looking at my phone, I could just listen to a video or tap my phone for one of my dumb mobile games.

-**Put doubles of my vitamins next to the couch.** This one might be more of an ADHD thing, but sometimes I literally don't have the motivation to take the supplements I badly require (such as iron) even if they're right there in front of me in the kitchen. My mind feels like it's too much work to get a glass of water, take out the vitamins, swallow em, and place the containers back in their spot. But every evening I watch shows on the couch with a snack and a drink. So in this scenario I'm sitting down, I already have a drink anyway, I'm already in a better mood because tv relaxing time, and taking the pills will feel like less work because of the distraction of the show (or if there is a boring part, commercial, or triggering scene I can use taking my pills as a welcome diversion).

For example, if he woke up feeling unwell it would stress him out immensely, but he wouldn’t look online for advice or book an appointment, he’d just tolerate it. I think it’s noteworthy that he lost his father very suddenly during childhood, and went back to school without processing the death. For that reason, he doesn’t want to speak to his mum about what he’s going through, because he doesn’t want to be a burden on her/feels like she has it worse than him. 
I myself have struggled with SH in the past and have ADHD so I am not unfamiliar to mental illness. I encourage him so often to see a counsellor, which is free via our university. He’s convinced talking therapy doesn’t work but I still encourage him to go. His family life is complicated so he won’t speak to any of them. His friends are mainly from secondary so he doesn’t really open up with them. I’ve also suggested he starts a hobby, tries to reach out to people on his course to make friends, write a diary or say affirmations but idk if he’s actually going to take my advice. 

I know we’re young but I really think we have the potential to get married one day if he gets over his trauma and learns to love himself. His positive days are so amazing and he’s the sweetest most charismatic person ever but when he becomes stressed he’s like a different person. Any advice on how I can help him help himself? or what I can do?"

We're slowly making the earth uninhabitable, the only reason anything changes is if rich people can find a wau to get richer from it, and to top it all off, everyone else is stuck in some bullshit waste of time job where someone gets rich off their labor.  What the fuck is the point in living if at least a third of the next 40 years of my life are wasted doing something i fucking hate?

By the time I'm done with it, I'm so mentally exhausted and frustrated that I have no desire to do anything.  I used to have hobbies.  I used to connect with friends.  I used to enjoy life.  Now, I dread waking up every single day, I barely leave the house, and my hobbies have all but disappeared except for an hour or two on the weekends before I inevitably lose interest again in favor of turning my brain off for the rest of the day.  I barely talk to anyone because that takes extra mental effort that I just don't fucking have.  I know I need therapy but there's no fucking way I can carve out time in my week for that, and it's fucking ridiculous that I need to pay an absurd amount of money just to maybe want to live.

Even though I agree with all the people that told me she was toxic I just can't help but feel regret and remorseful on how things ended. She came into my life at a time when I was afraid of interacting with others and despised most people. For her she'd say I was her best friend and she'd make subtle and not so subtle attempts to be around me as much as possible and it made me happy. She started to thaw the ice in my heart just as I did for her as she would tell me she doesn't have many friends and the ones she does have rarely spoke to her and even more uncommon was them making an effort to see her. I was a change of pace for her as I made an effort to talk to her and see her. I'd be there for her emotionally as well as I hated to see her cry and she'd come to me to talk about her past traumas and things that were currently bothering her. It became a norm that when she cried I'd hold her in my arms and she'd allow herself to melt. It'd eventually be a norm where I'd just hold her even when she wasn't crying and this made me feel good just as it did her. I'd put head on her lap and all my problems would just go away. Now I don't talk to her anymore and as much as I know it's for the best it also hurts so damn much. Made worse by the fact that my previous job of which I got her to work there with me because I wanted to help her find work and she meanwhile said yes for that reason and because it'd mean we could see each other more. They told me after I stopped working there and a family member of mine spread a lie if me being dead she got depressed and had suicidal thoughts. I'd clear up the lie to her personally but a week after that is when I cut her off and according to my previous job her depression didn't go away. She no longer had those suicidal thoughts but her depression stayed. Soon enough she'd quit because of it and my job said if she didn't quit they were planning in letting her go anyway because her work had been sliding. My heart hurts that I can't talk to her but it hurts more to know that she suffered from this. Life for me has been going up since I broke things off. I got a promotion in the army and I'm now a SGT, bought my own house, got a puppy, and a new job in the army that haa me in France right now. Yet this heartache I feel just won't go away. I miss you beautiful, I wish things didn't end the way it did, and I HATE the other people that made things worse and influenced our close friendship ending."

me and my friend was planning to study abroad together, everything was fine and i even got the letter of acceptance for the scholarship but then my Visa got rejected because ""i was doing paperwork too late"" meanwhile theres no deadline stated by the school or the embassy..but my friend still got the visa (we applied for the same university and everything) and successfully went to study; the whole operation took my friend 6 months but ive been trying for 2 years now which makes me question my actual worth.

So thats one thing; right after a few days i failed the scholarship, my gf of 1 year dump me because she think we are incompatible and she had lost the passion a while ago; i always willing to take criticism,  communicate and change the dynamics in the relationship but all of that still not what she wanted and shes getting tired of us... It really hurt me that when the breakup havent happened yet but she already moving on.

My parent divorced last year, lots of traumas but i kinda moved on emotionally from it until my mom recently told me that she is seeing another person; i mean hes a nice guy, he helped me and my mom to a degree but i just cant take the fact that why i cant have a proper family in the first place with my biological mom and dad instead.
Again, seeing my ex and my mom moved on so quickly (good for them) makes me really wonder that did they really care about their relationship or not.

Also my grandpa is dying...

All these thoughts are messing me up real hard, i cant even cry properly, life is so shit right now its like a joke, every effort i put in something WILL fail miserably, i cant continue to study at my old university without having to answer how i failed to study abroad with everyone that asked. I literally have no self esteem left and my heart still aches everytime i think about my ex.

It was due to moving to a new country, not being able to adjust to life at all, not fitting in @ school + tanking grades. I barely passed by the time I made it out of school. The worst 5 years of my life easily. I went to my psychiatrist multiple times, therapy numerous times + antidepressants.

Then I left the country for uni and went back home basically. I felt at ease again but still continued to suffer sorta what I call  “after shocks” - I was scared to fail, and even if something hit me hard in life and I couldn’t control it and people perceived me wrong in situations all I did was “give up” because that’s the only thing I can do.

I sleep away my sadness if that makes sense. I cannot cry anymore. It’s like I’ve drained the dam, there’s a drought in my system because I physically cannot cry even though I experience sadness often, my anxiety eats away at me but for some reason I’m still numb? 

What is this madness, I cannot even break away from it. Crying was my only outlet and I can’t even do that now? I’m not even sure if I still have depression to be honest. I feel empty, tired and over life in general. Feel like a 80 year old in a 20 year old’s body "

My entire life I have felt like i’ve had at the very least a low grade depression from since i was an itty baby to now. Over the past 2-3 years i felt like making a change in myself and tried tk actively better myself. I lost 100 pounds and stopped being obese and overweight, formed new but isolated hobbies, connected deeply with friends, and continued working on my academic track in a field that make enough money that it won’t be a problem like it has been all my life. Despite this, it feels like internally I’ve been getting worse. Two years ago I started having epiphanies thinking how much more comforting it would be if I wasn’t alive. A year ago I started to, in the background of the constant noise in my head, have formed a semi-active suicide plan. Now I have constant thoughts of suicide during the negative part of my mood swings. I’ve been recently going to campus therapy and have a plan for a psychiatry visitin about a month, and am waiting on medicaid approval to find actual consistent mental health treatment outside of campus. It’s felt like as I try to make myself into a generally better person, I only internally get worse. My intrusive thoughts become more vivid, louder in my brain. I think believe that constantly say they love me are using me, or that they hate me. I think I’m worthless and unloveable. I have to lock myself in my room during the bad part of my mood swing and just lay still on my bed to get suicidal images to stop.

1bii3ot,I4mC0nfusi0n,2,0.0,1710848143,depression,"Is it Normal to Lose Your Understanding of What's Worth Freaking Out Over and What isn't?  Hi.


I had a very bad experience less than 2 years ago. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously but I think it has changed my brain and now my  brain cells don't really understand what's really tragic and what is not.


Usually when I'm talking about my experience it feels like I'm talking about a movie. I make jokes about it. I feel ""disconnected"" from it. Like, really, I make some very dark jokes about it that it actually surprises the listener. I can't cry talking and thinking about it. (I do feel super anxious and worried thinking and talking about it though, but I can't cry. It's not sadness I'm feeling, it's anxiety... A lot of it).


Then there was this one time I talked about it and ended up shaking and crying which confused me because I was ""fine"" talking about it before... Then back to ""no crying"" again. Which was weird... (The serious anxiety stayed though, but the sadness was gone again).


Another thing is... It's like my sense of what is ""tragic"" and what isn't has been absolutely screwed after the experience. Serious problems and obstacles that freak most people out don't bother me at all, but then much smaller stuff leave me bawling my eyes out for days. 


It's like I'm super strong and super weak at the same time! It's as if somehow your body doesn't feel your bones getting shattered, but feels tremendous pain when you step on a Lego.

After the longest time, things are looking up. I’m starting to get my shit together, but there’s still this thing behind me, I don’t known what it is, but I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Watching all my friends fall in love, and having the time of their lives, it hits pretty hard. My best friend, who’s a lot more depressed than I am, has found a boyfriend, who is a great guy. My band mates are both in relationships or in the talking phase, and I’m sitting here not even knowing what the hell I’m doing tomorrow. I feel like I’m watching other people have their cake and be eating it. All the people that I would want to talk to, I think that they really don’t care about it. My biggest worry is that if I open up to them, that I’d be weird, and I’d lose them.  
I wonder if I’ll ever find someone, just someone who I can talk to, not even someone to fall in love with.

I recently realised, after a long time, that I’m not gay, or straight, but I’m bi. I have this weird internalised biphobia that I always wonder if I’m just making it up, or that I’m in denial that I’m gay or straight, and I feel like I’m just doing everything wrong when it comes to this. I just wish that it was simpler than this, that depression didn’t keep fucking up my life. I’ve lost a lot of time to it.

I have very few friends, and being around people who can walk up to someone who they’ve never talked to and be best friends with them after a 5 minute conversation makes me wonder if I’m the problem when it comes to meeting people.

Sorry about this rambling mess, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I don’t mind if no one reads this, I understand you’ve all got stuff going on, I’m just a random internet stranger."

However even with all that I still think about the pandemic and how it impacted the world and kinda miss it but at the same time I don’t.
What messes with my head even more was that I was hoping some horrific event would happen so that the world would start over… yet nothing has. 
Things are still “normal” and I have to focus on my errands.

Its terrifying because recently people on insta have been posting this trend where kids are celebrating having two weeks off of school just to cut to a present version of themselves looking horrified.

Did we all gain consciousness from de-realization? Or are we all mentally preparing ourselves for another catastrophe due to intuition?

Why is the pandemic and our misery being romanticized?

For a bit I didn’t really know the core reason why I got so depressed and why I want to kill myself for seemingly no reason. My family isn’t the best and my relationship with both of my parents is not great. I just assumed it was because my home life was shit. I had a dream as a child of being sa’ed by my brother who is three years my senior. I was very little when this dream happened so I don’t know why I’d dream about that. I told my mom about this dream a year ago but I didn’t tell her it was my brother in the dream. She asked if it was my brother and told me she thought it was because when I was 4-5 she walked in on my brother making me kiss his genitalia because he thought it was funny. She asked if maybe more happened. I said it wasn’t him in the dream because I was scared, I had no recollection of this happening. I was so shocked and hurt. She said she didn’t tell anyone because he was a kid too. Now I kinda forgot (or blocked it out?) about this for a while but 3 ish years ago my brother and I were close. Very close, I was in his room twenty four seven. He would play fight with me and I would end up straddling him, he would hold me there. Looking back I want to vomit. He would give me a massage and rub right on my side boob and other icky things in hindsight. I don’t speak to him anymore, I hate being in the same room as him and even speaking to him. I just dropped him. I used to get angry if he stared at me too long and I don’t know why. No one knows why I stopped being friends with him, not even him (I assume). Every inappropriate thing is blurry to me. My memory’s even worse nowadays because of my depression. 
I have another brother who’s two years my senior, he’s my favourite person. He’s still close with my brother who sa’ed me. Sometimes I want to tell him so bad. Should I tell him? All my brothers live at home with me and mom. I’m scared what will happen if I tell anyone. I want to die so badly and I think it could all be from the trauma, maybe it’s why I fell into depression. I don’t know what’ll happen if I say anything I don’t want him to know I know. What if he denies it or doesn’t even remember it that way? I’m scared of what will happen.

I've been on it for a little over two months, and im in the purging stage (when your acne gets really bad). It has brought back by body dismorphia, self loathing, and deppression back in full swing. I've worked really hard to get rid of that and honnestly i think it was back before i started taking treatment. But mutiple times a day i have self harming thoughts and i hate it. And i know thats a terriable idea and im not actually gonna do anything to myself. But their has been two things nawing at me the worse tho. Im in a state where im not validating these feelings and kinda just pretending its the acutane and not a promblem with myself. The second is i cant talk to people about this. No one can really tell Im hurting because i betray this bubbly optismistic person, and even if i come clean and tell someone i trust. Im struggeling they dont get it, they act like they understand but they never can acurately help me or even listen. 

Then their was something that happend to me today. I am a theature kid and for our play i kiss a girl, two actually but one kisses me on the cheek. (Probably worse) and we havent yet but we still practice where we do. The part where we do kiss she has this face that looks like she thinks im just disgusting. The worse part is i really like her too she's sweet, kind, and buetiful. We're good friends already and i've known her since kindergarten. And at the end of the day i dont even blame my acne looks so nasty and i have the ugliest smile. 

If you've taken acutane before please tell me if i should stop taking it but i really dont want to. And if you can say any words to that please do but either way its nice to be heard and get it off my chest."

when i was under 18 i was unable to get professional help due to my parents but now i am medicated and seeing a therapist, but it’s not getting any better. if anything, it’s made me lose even more hope since i’ve lost the naive idea that i had in the past that it would start getting better once i had a better support system.

i’m in college and the past two semesters my grades absolutely tanked due to inability to show up for class and do work. i was put on academic probation this semester because i failed three classes and i was convinced that i would be able to come back from it but my grades are just as bad this semester. 

i know i need to drop out and try doing something else, and maybe revisit college in the future. i would be find with that except i now live twelve hours away from my parents in washington dc. i can’t afford to stay here without being in a student dorm so if i drop out i’ll be forced to leave all my friends, my therapist, and essentially the whole life i’ve built here. i’d have to move back in with my parents which i know would make my mental state so much worse.

1bic0de,LittleReactionToLife,2,3.0,1710823171,depression,"20 years since my last suicide attempt i’m now back in the hole A year ago I had a nervous breakdown and burnout. someone I loved turned out was abusing me for the second time in my life. It lead to a melt down and breakup that caused ptsd so bad that I lost all my friends and job. I’m currently living in an apartment with the help of a parent who is paying my rent currently because my last relationship that abused me drained my bank accounts after i lost a job  leading to bankruptcy. 

I’m going to be turning 40 in may and I don’t think I can get back up. I have been dealing with alot of emotional distegulation, depersonalization, derealization, and significant anxiety that has caused bouts of agoraphobia. I can’t stop crying and basically have to force myself to eat while at the same time my body feels like it’s breaking down.

I’m so tried and I feel it’s too difficult to climb out of this pain. When I try to work my brain feels overwhelmed and overloaded. I can’t even handle being around people. My moods shifts so hard and I find everything so overwhelming from tv to movies to even music. I get no joy out of life anymore and just have constant anxiety and stress migraines.

I just don’t see a way around this anymore I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not religious or spiritual but i’m tired and just not sure what to live for anymore. Everything takes so much out of me and my health since this meltdown has gone down hill rapidly. 

I just want to not feel this feeling of failure anymore and loneliness and anxiety. I want to feel happy again but i don’t think that’s happening anytime soon or ever again. The ptsd, the depression, anxiety, and life collapse has made me realize i have nothing and no one to live for.

I don’t even have retirement or a car anymore. 

I also don’t want to go through another election cycle. I can’t take how openly consumerism driven, cruel, classist, and vitriolic people have gotten in the last 20 years to everyone.

Been through the deepest, darkest and lowest pits of my life barely before becoming an adult. As a child and teenager with health issues. Change of mood, emotions, thought patterns, life choices and responsibilities. It took a u-turn within a moment. Had an effect on my whole livelihood and purpose of being. Restricted. Isolated. I slowly started to lose my purpose in life.

Interpersonal relationships have never been the brightest spot in my life. People change, grow and we all have our differences. We argue, we complain, we have our flaws. It was never meant to be, yet something deep down inside makes me fuelled with anger and resentment with how ridiculously ignorant and selfish one can be. All of what you could have and what was there for you suddenly swiped when you left. Growing together as one, becoming closer and stronger for it to break like glass. We could’ve had that but it all came shattering down. Now the trust and bond is never the same and the way I look at you.

Life is continuous. It flows. Even after losing my job I never thought I’d be in a position of being so deep down in the dumpster when I was once an optimistic filled person. I’m lost. I don’t see a purpose in my life. I don’t know which direction to turn. I have so many unanswered questions. Health, people, life.

But with my current situation.. I don’t know what to say…

I’ve been talking to this girl and she seems to like me/ is interested in me. But we are kinda still on talking terms. Her mother passed away a year ago. And ever since that incident. She’s just unable to recover. She’s always depressed and suffering that grief on a daily basis. She talked to me about it only once. And then closed the topic. She was afraid she would be a burden on me to which I denied that, and told her to talk to me if she ever needed to vent.

But what does someone possibly say or do that is comforting in such a situation?  the death of a loved one.. specially when it’s your mother is near unrecoverable. If that happened to me I straight up won’t be able to recover.

These thoughts are deeply distressing because they clash with my core values—I don't want these thoughts, yet they persist. Alongside this, I experience cognitive dissonance, where I'm torn between what I know to be true and the intrusive thoughts that suggest otherwise. This conflict is confusing and causes me considerable stress.

Emotional dysregulation has also been a part of my experience. My emotions feel intense and sometimes unpredictable, reacting strongly to life's stressors, changes, and even moments of reflection about my life and where I'm headed. These fluctuations make me question if I might be depressed, adding another layer of complexity to my mental health landscape.

The impact of these challenges on my daily life and sense of self is significant. I'm seeking clarity and resolution, trying to understand these experiences in the context of OCD and whether deeper emotional issues or trauma might be influencing these patterns.

by the end of 12th it felt mostly  depressed no real interest just pushing on and on in this rat race then corona came and all dam broke then i dropped of college then depression and anxiety took over me and became part of me slowly and i became different kind of stable ,

i guess i was stable with depression before corona too but now  i am next stage of stable i guess . now i can do anything with depressed state of mind like studying or doing some work or anything . unmotivated but still can get the work done.

now if i am not depressed i will feel weird and something missing in life .

  pushing forward with depression kind of excites me make me feel special or something .

well i like it this way.

talk here to relive myself sometimes feels ll good i guess.

most of the times i try not to divulge  my depression in thoughts that it my depress others. talking all that BS of motivation to others when i myself am too depressed .

But I really feel this huge void inside me once I'm left with my thoughts, when I tell this to my loved ones they just shut me off by saying

You don't have depression stop acting you're laughing all the time and having fun with your friends.

I get upset in little things for days , small arguments about me being wrong or just someone saying something silly about me, I just end up feeling bad about it for days ( simple bantering with my buddies just makes me sulk so bad ).

Because of this I just break down sobbing when I actually have serious arguments and I just keep crying to the point that it's becoming annoying to my gf too. I just am sad all the time about shit and I don't know the reason.

I hate getting help because nobody understands and they just keep on giving me instant solutions instead of talking to me , nobody cares and nobody has the fucking time. They give me solutions like do this do that. Go exercise, go out, don't do this don't smoke, nobody wants to talk about what I'm feeling why I'm feeling.. this world just sucks.

I am worried about myself I really don't want to die, but I just feel like nobody would really care if I disappeared tomorrow. My parents would, but they would also move on. 
 
I just don't want to talk about it to anyone they just dismiss the convo by making me feel like I'm boring them with my conversation. I just feel like I have so much to say to this world but it doesn't listen. I have so much love to give but there's nobody to receive it.

I have a healthy family, we are well off, I'm earning good money,good job overall apart from general corporate bullshit . I like to think I have good friends they have always helped me , but I think they're not smart enough to understand topics like depression. To them depressed person is a person who doesn't laugh and doesn't smile. 

I just miss myself, and I really don't want to give up on myself, I start crying when I have suicidal thoughts I really don't want to do it. But I'm worried that If it keeps going like this I'll just do it one day impulsively and then regret it instantly but then it'll be too late.

I don't trust anyone to understand me. Not even actual therapists..  😞"

Yet, in doing so, I am also belittling myself, saying that I could never do what they do. And I am right — I will never get a resume that long. I will never have these opportunities. I will have money or power. And I am losing my friend because every success of theirs is a shortcoming of my own.

And it is jealousy, yes. And low self-esteem. And it’s crushing me. It’s honestly destroying me. And I know I need to be grateful for what I have, but I have no talents. I can’t even write a resume that gets to a page. I’ve never had someone fall in love with me. I’m afraid I’ll lose my best friend either through my own jealousy, or they’ll attain so much success that I’ll be left behind. I have no passion.

1bichac,Opening_Memory_6262,1,3.0,1710824823,depression,"Am I still depressed? Ok where do i begin, starting off im going to mainly be ranting, sorry if this post just seems like rambles but i really just want to get my thoughts out and see if anyone understands.

I am a 15 year old male, i have an amazing girlfriend, extremely wise and understanding father, and a few close friends. My mother, whom i used to live with, was very damaging and caused me alot of mental health problems. I made a post about those in the past(which ive since deleted) asking why i still suffered after getting away from her. One of the commentors on that post told me i may have trauma and still needed to heal(therapy, time, etc.). That all ended a out a year ago, cut to 5ish months ago I made a new friend. While this friend isnt all that important that introduced me to my now girlfriend(16yo). I will not give any more information on her as i dont want to disrupt her privacy. She is absolutely amazing and supports me in any way she can, she hates my mother more than even I(albeit i dont really resent her). She helped me through a really rough patch where my mother threatened to take custody of me. This led to my father defending me(I am very thankful and proud to be his son, especially after this) from her, showing her he is much more likely to win custody over me as he has both my favor and proof of her absence since i moves in with him. After all of that I have almost completely cut contact, with the exception of talking to my 9yo half brother who lives with her.

This was a month ago and ive almost forgotten about it. I do not believe there is any reason for me to be sad, however i still feel like im lacking something. Every day i wake up to my cheerful girlfriend(we fall asleep on facetime every night) and it always makes me feel glad to be alive. I have no reason to be sad anymore, what is missing.

(At this point in writing i took a few minutes to think about it)

I think after 5 years of dealing with my mother(she got really bad when i was 10), ive been forced to sort of mature. I certainly am not saying i am an adult, or even close to being one, but i do think i was torn from my childhood a too early on. I feel like ive been robbed, and now i notice every day that nothing is the same as when i was little. Dont get me wrong, my life right now is amazing, but i still feel like i have lost some thing, i want to look at the world as challenging, like i did when i was younger, i wanf to feel like i can rely on people rather than knowing how to handle everything. 

I know right now i am very good at handing stressful situations, and while it is somewhat rewarding i wish i didn't have to go through what i did to prepare me for that. I wanted a normal childhood where i am prepared to take on the world in a healthy way, not suddenly forcing me into maturity.

I do feel robbed, and i do wish i could get what ive lost back, but at the end of the day i dont think i would change anything, i have awesome people around me and i would relive all of it 100x over to stay with them.

So what do you guys think, what am i? Could it be depression still or am i past it all?"

I haven't done anything productive in weeks. 

I feel dead inside, that i don't have the will to live. I find myself craving for that next show to binge or that next game to get hooked to just to feel alive for a few hours until I get burnt out and go back to wallowing.  

I don't think I could break out of my loop on my own, I badly need someone to help me. But I don't know how to ask for it. 

I currently live with my parents, i told them about feeling this way for a long time, but they just say I'm just lazy or I'm not ""praying"" enough. I had been feeling this way for more than 3 years now but they never acknowledge it cause they don't really believe depression is a thing. No one i knew IRL does either.

Can't ask for help from my other relatives, since currently our family is financially in debt from our relatives. They'll probably just get angry at me and say I'm just making up excuses to not pay them back. 

I'm particularly friendless too, cause ever since I started spiraling down, i had isolated myself and ghosted every friend i had. I keep thinking about reaching out to them, but I keep worrying about how they'll react. I'm nothing but a ghost.

I had thought about calling some help line, but the only thing we have around here are mostly for suicide prevention. I just feel guilty, and ashamed of taking time away from volunteers who could be saving someone in the brink of death just to listen to me whine about my life when I don't particularly have urges to die.

Not that it never crossed my mind, it's just that, I'm more scared about the ""nothingness"" that comes after death. So I try to cling to my existence. If haven't been a coward, I probably would have offed myself.

Anyway, my social anxiety keeps getting worst too. I haven't talked to anyone else aside from direct family members either these last few weeks. The other day, so kid selling something knocks on our door and I just pretended there's no one at home cause I don't want to talk to them. I also just let my phone rang cause I can't handle to answer it either. Just thinking about job interviews makes me want to curl down into a ball.

Just signed divorce papers for the abusive ex I left at the end of 2022. Years of mental abuse. He drove everyone away from me. Still picking up pieces, still finding new things I have to heal from. Still financially screwed because of him.

My dad died during our relationship, and he was the only person who could love me through all of my pain, my mood swings, severe depression.. he's the only reason I survived my teens. My ex had made him feel so unimportant before he passed, and I can't ever undo that.

I can't keep a job because of chronic illness. I've been fired twice in 6 months because of severe pain I can not manage. I could be in better shape, if only I could afford to eat properly. But I can't, because I can't keep a job and still am recovering from the ex-husband. 

I filed my taxes and they still haven't come in, despite everyone else's (including my bf who filed the same day) getting theirs. But now, that'll only cover rent anyway. Which is terrifying, because I'm almost out of my depression meds. 

And I'm so depressed that I don't have any hopes. I don't see this all turning out okay. I have nothing but cashier/customer service experience. Say I get a good job. Well, they're just gonna fire me before my 90 days and say it isn't the right job for me.  Or, say I find a job that works with my inability to sit or stand for prolonged periods AND pays me enough to survive. Well, corporate USA is just gonna move the goalposts so I'm back to being in poverty. 

I can feel agoraphobia setting in. It gets hard for me, when I get this heavily depressed. I hear real gunshots everywhere in my neighborhood. Sirens cause ptsd flares from my dad's death. I imagine everyone is going to follow me home from the bus stop (never happened, but I have been harassed). I imagine my dog dying at home alone (possible, since she's 17). This only happens when I have no confidence in myself, to the point where the current state of the world becomes terrifying. 

I can't shake this, I can't focus on anything. So my question is this: how do you shake yourself out of this? How do I get back to the boisterous, fun-loving, brilliant, magnetic person I am when I'm not in a funk/state of existential dread?? I lost my insurance, so I no longer have therapy. I'm scared of the future, it looks so bleak. I'm scared of the past, it's just so much trauma. And the present fucking SUCKS.

I hate the way i talk, i hate the way i think, i hate the way i look. It’s funny to me how i manage to forget all of this sometimes, and then i will live a couple days happy, at least to the outside. But it only takes one wrong move to completely destroy all of the “confidence” I’ve built up. 
I don’t know when i had my first suicidal thought, but I would suspect somewhere around 9 years old. I do however remember my first encounter with SH, 12. 
I don’t know why I’m depressed or suicidal. I have everything I should need to be happy. I have amazing parents who I’ve sadly drifted away from as many teenagers do, and I have also awesome friends who i know would support me through anything. I realised i was in love with one of the girls in my friend group about a year ago, and we have gotten closer for some time now. As a matter of fact I’m pretty sure she likes me to some degree at least, but our relationship is far from perfect and we still have a lot of shit between us. I’ve come to realise that I don’t deserve any of this. I know I’m important to the group, and I’ve definitely earned a place in it, but i feel like I’m only dragging people down. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear. It would be better for everyone, they wouldn’t have to drag me around and I wouldn’t have to pretend to be happy all the time.
My life is just filled with guilt. Im at a point where I’m unsure if i even want he to love me back, since i know i will never be able to be who she deserves. I just want her to be happy, and i no longer care if i need to disappear in the process. Man i love her so much. It’s funny how the thought of love blends with the thought of a knife though my throat.

 I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I genuinely have no where else to go. Im not diagnosed with anything too so I’m not sure if “depression” is the word I would use to describe what I’m feeling. 

It all started when I was 10 years old. I’m a 10 year old who hit puberty and developed breasts overnight. I had a full blown C cup by 11. Most kids my age haven’t even learnt what menstruation was in class. I am also living in Asia (Singapore) and the beauty standard here is extremely slim girls. let’s just say my curvyness was not something I admired in myself. I had always been slightly overnight but my big boobs made me look bigger than what I actually was. I became extremely self conscious and began to isolate myself (mentally at least) from people. However, that was just the beginning. Meanwhile, I was also dealing with racism from my peers, being excluded and treated like shit, called slurs and seen as dirty by literal children and also some teachers (although they didn’t say shit like that, they re-enforced harmful stereotypes and made my race the centre of jokes) Although that’s something I’ve dealt with since I was in 1st grade, I began distancing myself from anything “Indian” abt me which led to my 2-3 years of internalised racism filled persona lmfao. (Fucking embarrassing now that I look back on it)  it would maybe be a different story if my breasts grew right but I had tubular breasts. (Search it up) this chased me so much physical pain, the effects of which translated into self destruction. 

As I entered secondary school, my problems delved even deeper. I was a decent student the first year, but I because so so anxious all the time, I couldn’t or rather didn’t focus on school, being disciplined and began indulging in food as comfort + doom scrolling. This is when my actual downfall began. My boobs just got bigger, my insecurity just got worse and worse, I close myself off from people. I stopped going out with friends, I didn’t want people to see me because I felt so ugly and disgusting. I rotted away scrolling on social media and hoping staring at fit girls would inspire me to lose weight and become THAT GIRL yk. anyways, i lost my will to live and at 14, i tried to end it. But I was dumb and nothing happen lol i just woke up HAHHAHA. anyways, i began failing all my classes. I would somehow go to the next year by just passing my final exams. Idk how. I didn’t study, I didn’t care abt myself. I couldn’t do anything. I lost all my confidence in my abilities. 

Fast forward to 18, I finally got a breast reduction. I’m currently recovering. But now, I feel like those around me think my problems are solved. But I have been in like a flight or fight mode with extreme anxiety filling my days for the past decade or so. I failed my A levels (major 12th grade exams). Like completely flunked them. And I’m obv doing them again this year. But I have no faith in myself. I don’t trust myself. I am feeling so extremely suicidal these past few days because of how much of a failure I am. All I do is waste my parents hard earned money. I feel so useless. I don’t wanna live anymore. I’m nothing but a burden to those around me and I don’t know how to get through my future. I’m scared and I just want to not feel anything at all. idk why I’m posting this. I just needed to get it out. Ik im very young and only 18 and am foolish af, but idk how to handle everything rn. "

Today was a bad day. Full of self-loathing and sadness. 

I went to a local bar/record store that I frequent. They have a very small patio with two benches. I was sitting on one and a group of young couples came in and needed the space so I got up. But the sight of all these young happy people (I’m 59) sort of triggered me. So I left, and cried in my car and then when I got home. 

My kids are all grown and I don’t have many friends here to hand out with. They’re all over the country, but none of them visit me. I visit them. 

I have one friend here, really, but she’s not interested in me. In fact she has said that our age disparity (19 years) makes her uncomfortable. She prefers young people. Young men.

About 6 months ago he fell into another depression and was recommended increasing his dosage to 60mg. This didn’t work and the doctor added Wellbutrin to the mix while weening off Paxil. His depression went away but he describes terrible withdrawal like symptoms such as profuse sweating, insomnia, ocasional jitters and bowel issues. His doctor then suggested he ween back on paxil, and after a few weeks with no improvements, suggested he start weening off again. He’s in a vicious cycle and believes he may have serotonin syndrome. It seems the doctor is playing with a bunch of medicines until they hit the right one. Has anyone experienced something similar and have any advice? Thanks in advance. "

I wanted to transition earlier but NHS waitlists were so full I would probably be still on it now if I waited and I couldn't afford private care at the time. Unfortunately for me when I could finally afford private care it was too late and the damage was done. I was lucky that I realized that it was too late and I would never look like a woman. So I just transition in secret. I've been on HRT for about 2 and half years and the only people that know are my family. To everyone I work with and the people that see me day to day I'm just a short man who looks slightly androgynous.

The most difficult part now is that I can't even wear a t-shirt anymore because I'm scared people will see my boobs. So I'm always wearing these extremely baggy jumpers even in the summer and it's just hell. It's really tough but I know I don't have a choice. No employer is gonna want to employ a man with boobs.

* Ages 0 - 18, poverty stricken, authoritative, trauma filled child hood. 
* Ages 18 - 23. Overall enjoyed college, luckily studied something that was lucrative and moved into middle/upper middle class income levels. Due to being poor, getting through college was a bit of navigating so probably could have been a better experience. Still better than being at home.
* Ages 23 - 34 - best years of my life. Free, independent, making money, enjoying life. Living it up. Doing what I wanted. Almost had some insight that I shouldn't go to the next stage of marriage/kids because life wouldn't get better than this. Ego and thinking I would be the exception probably influenced thinking.
* Ages 34 - 40 (present) - Had kids. 2 kids, one with special needs. Life is hell. No sleep ever. Always working. Fun is slim. Anger skyrocketing. Depressed all the time. On meds. Did therapy. Still angry. Honestly feels like nothing will ever help. Feel cheated by the universe. Feel bitter at the universe. Don't like being around people. Tired all the time. Miserable. Everyone close to me has compassion fatigue. Hired helped. Never enough. Always spiraling.

So there we are. I'm angry and bitter and resentful and always day dreaming about life before kids. Why did I fuck up something good. Why did I put myself through this hell. Because one child is special needs, that means it may never get better. I may always be struggling. I knew before I had kids if one had special needs it would break me. It has. I'm broken. Therapists just constantly repeat the same thing: cope. Cope. Cope. Cope. Here is another technique. It's like a gym instructor yelling at a concentration camp victim to do more pushups.

Well so basically after a solid life until I was 15 with 16 I got depressed because I was bad in school no friends etc. you name it, I try to keep it as short as I can. Well basically I was not able to do anything, I was only on my phone, because for years I almost only played games ( more for the grind then the fun until I noticed it was not what I want from life) then basically 2020- I was improving, got new friends, made an own Business that creaters me an income over 6 figures a year from going to schooland being bad at school, grew muscle, talked to girls, starting my relashionship with god and so on. BUT then I guess you could say I kinda lost myself for a while did not hit my friends up, did not talk to girls no more, fewer workouts, and everything went slowly down hill BUT my money which grew like crazy, so much that I won't even have to work till 30. Now the problem starts: I started do became anxious what if I fail, what if xyz happens, had like small mental breakdowna late 2022, then after barely smoking weed in early 2023 after those stressfull 2 years constantly working 10 hours a day for 365 days a year no breaks ( yea you can see a pattern I love to grinf once I can not grind/ feel like it is useless I become depressed af) but worse I took like 15 hits of concentrated THC it was like 95 percent a pen. After I started hallucinating ( worked 10 hours before, which was stressful af, drunk coffee like 30 minutes before I started smoking) I had several panic attacks while the THC was making me hallucinate, having Intrusive thoughts and hellllla anxiety, losz controll over my body. After it wore down i felt like something was off. Then like 2 month before that I got diagnosed with colitis ( IBD) which is basically a gut disease, which made my parents have to call the ambulance bc a flare almost killed me, shitted my pants, etc. My dumbass kept working all day long until I became these dpdr like smptoms, like lifes only a movie, of course I knew it is only a feeling, but a terrible one. Then over the months September - now I became so depressed, I feel like shit. Well now I go to a psychologist, my IBD got muchhh better, because I started taking care of my diet again etc. I also started meeting friends again, do sports, spend time with family and so on but only a few weeks ago I noticed that I fell for the money trap, now I d exchange everything for my 2020 me again. What advice could you give me? I started meditaing again, too everything you coulr imagine, still feel the dpdr most of the time, kinda anxiety and depression. Got so bad that I went to my doctor, they wanna do a checkup, maybe it is a disbalance in my brain? ( Reward system?) Idek... It makes me sick, crying bc of the dissociative symptoma, anxiety and depression it is like a loop that does not end.

Hi everyone, idk how to start this, let me rewind about one and a half years ago. The summer after my school year that summer i decided to change i worked the hardest to lose weight and look better, and it worked i lost about 25 kilograms or 55 pounds in the span of 2 months and I weighed 77 kg i have never felt better i looked better and dressed better but more importantly my confidence was thru the roof the following school year was awesome i made alot of new connections and friends simply i was enjoying my hardworking in summer i was very happy fast forward to this same day last year mar/18/23 that day i overheard some guys in my class talking about masturbation. To be clear i knew what is masturbation and how its done but i also knew it was addictive and not very healthy so i just never got to try it but that day i just for some reason  wanted to try it i went back home then i just started scrolling on ig and by luck i saw a reel of a very attractive woman and my thing got hard so i just decided to give it a go and about 5 minutes later i felt the best feeling of my life, even tho i enjoyed it very much i was firm on not doing it again,  but the next day i fell for it again , and again, and again after about 2 weeks i realized that ive become almost addicted to it from that day i have always tried to quit but nothing worked there was a point where i was doing it 4 times a day… fast forward to today exactly one year after i first tried it and my lufe is ruined because of it i now weigh 110kg wich means i gained 40 kg in one year i now look like shit and im morbidly obese my height have gone down by 5cm because of how much my spine was curved i have lost all my friends i litterally know NOONE outside of my family i have developed the most fucked up fetishes and the most humiliating fetishes everybody in my school now thinks im weird even tho i do nothing all day i wouldn’t say im depressed.

I would kill to be like everyone else and have a 'personality', but all I see is objectivity and everything beyond that I mark it as unecessary and fake. (And I know my feelings are unjustified, which is why I hate my life so much more. Why cant I just be normal and be happy??)

I’m very conscious about my weight especially since I used to get fat shamed alot in my past and even tho everyone has been telling me I’m underweight and look sick, I’m always wary about the amount I eat. I don’t think I’ve felt or seen the change that I’ve lost alot. I know I have but I don’t feel it. Everytime I eat more than usual, I get stressed out and go on a diet or exercise to lose weight again. The more I lose, the more I have to need to lose weight. I’ve been tired for weeks or maybe months atp and I feel like I’m ruining my relations with my love ones cus of it. I honestly don’t know how to explain what I’ve been feeling but everytime I’m happy, I suddenly get this wave of emotions and I feel hopeless and numb again.

Usually my relationships only consist of jokes and having fun in person. Outside of meeting up with people or school, i only talk to one person who i’ve been friends with for about 10 years.

While i’ve been struggling with these thoughts and depression for a years, it’s finally getting worse to the point i’ve been avoidant of everyone even that friend. I haven’t been messaging them for a few days so i asked to meet up to apologize and explain whats been going on through my head. Basically i finished it off by saying that i’ve been hurting myself and having suicidal thoughts which is why i haven’t been in the mood i always try to display. After that they just told me it’s fine and we just sat there in silence until i asked what they’ve been up to, then they lit up and talked like i never said anything. 

Whenever they talk about their problems with me im always trying to be considerate of them and always check up on them. Also this is like the first actual time i’ve tried to talk about this because usually they don’t take me seriously.

An impish fiend upon my back, breathing fear into my palm.
It speaks of dread, it speaks of doubt, its voice a piercing spike,
A creature wrought of my own angst, the demon known as Anxiety.

It clings to me, a shadow's weight, that no light can dispel,
Whispering futures bleak and grim, in a never-ending spell.
Each breath a gasp, each thought a race, in panic's tight embrace,
A relentless specter feeding on the quickened pulse it chases.

And there, in the depths, a presence lurks, a slime that seeks to drown,
The demon of Depression, in its ooze, it drags me down.
It creeps, it covers, head to toe, a second, clinging skin,
A viscous shroud of hopelessness, that seeps into my grin.

Together they dance, a macabre waltz, to a tune that's mine alone,
One speaks of fear, the other despair, in a never-ending drone.
But fight I must, and fight I will, against these demons' throng,
For within this heart, a flame still burns, defiant, fierce, and strong.

My two close friends are never there anymore. One left abroad and only returns every 3 months, and one is in an all consuming relationship where I only see him once every 3/4 weeks. The rest of the time I'm alone, no car at home, working/studying. I tried to make new friends but it never catches on since the younger years have their clicks and mine is unreliable. It feels like being abandoned, in my 5th year I got into a roommate situation and that helped but honestly I feel like I am suffocating her , but she smiles as she fears confrontation, sometimes I feel like  she pretends to be my friend, a dark thought. But anyways, she'd smile, agree to a plan I made for a nice park trip or to catch a movie, as if nothing is wrong but then disappears early to do other plans so she doesn't feel the pressure to include me. 
I feel like my presence is parasitic,and it dwells on my concious that only I reach out to my friends to check up on them  without them ever baring a thought that I get lonely. I've expressed it to them before, my two close friends, and their response is the usual ""Oh I'm sorry you feel that way"" it's never taking the initiative to do something or giving me a spontaneous call. 

I could travel? But then I'd be alone, i tried that it was nice to meet some people but it doesn't fix anything. It feels like a void that pulls me towards the center and doesn't let me go.. that no one cares about me and no matter how much I try to impact my friends' lives it won't change the worth they see of mine, that no matter how much I give of something they don't bother to give back.

I have also been feeling less motivated to go to school, and would frequently skip class when I usually have not before. At first, I attributed all of these symptoms to seasonal depression (which I have every year), but now my dreary mood hasn't seemed to go away even when spring is starting. 

I have also been sleeping more and more, like 2 naps for 2 - 3hours a day as well as sleeping at night for 6+ hours. 

Honestly, my major concern is my lack of need for social interaction. I don't know if this is normal, or if I have gotten to the phase in my life where I am happy with just myself. I don't want to go to a therapist about these concerns because I feel as if it's all very minuscule compared to people with actual depression. Could someone please tell me if what I'm feeling is normal?"

For the past decade I have been working in jobs that have kept me physically fit and I took this job after I was told that I would be physically active.

In the past eleven months I have put on forty pounds and my joints are sore from mandatory sitting without stretching.  Stretching was considered socializing in that employer, as was drinking water.

Every job I have kept my head down and performed as asked, yet this never makes management happy and I get turned into a punching bag.  I always end up being terminated, or forced to resign, for sudden attitude problems.

There was one employer that made me a lead for three years and I never treated my subordinates poorly.  The rookies were to be elevated, not torn down.

I am at a dilemma wanting to know what the point really is.  Why work if the manager appreciates my work in the beginning, but suddenly feels the need to take out his aggression on me.  Why are people so cruel?  I am burnt out and am looking for a reason to continue with life.  Why does G*d allow me to be depressed?  Why does the workplace have problems with introverts?"

1bhsy97,Sweaty-Cucumber-1409,2,0.0,1710774321,depression,"I'm afraid to move forward I just got scammed today and the money that was scammed was not even my money but my mum. The scammer was very professional and I couldn't believe myself that it was a scam. It's very systematic from the beginning that I couldn't believe that I bought into all their lies.

The scam basically pretend as an immigration officer and police officer and they said that I got tangled into some online gambling scheme (that's actually illegal where I live). They even gave me their credentials to make me believe that they're real officials. They asked me about my personal information and I give it to them like some old people who gave trick or treat to some kids at Halloween.

Then they also asked me to send them some money. They said that they would send it back and at the time, there's nothing inside of my mind that it's obviously fishy. At the time, I just want the problem solved as fast as possible and didn't careful enough to smell that something is definitely wrong.

Because I don't have any money as a 24M who is unemployed; flung out of college twice; and still figuring out what I want to do with my life; I asked my mum to borrow her money. I told her that I would give it back because that was what the so called 'officials' said to me. But my mum was very sharp and she said that there's no way that an official would asked for money. But at the time, I'm very desperate to get away from this problem that I don't heed what she said. And I don't know why either, maybe because she loved me or maybe I'm such an asshole motherfucker, I made her believe me and she eventually gave me her money. 

I send the money to the fucking scammer, they sold me their lies that they will gave me back my money, and then they fucking gone like a fucking fart. I keep waiting like a good dog until they came back to gave me back my goddamn money but they never came. Then my mum asked me to check, was that actually real officials that I talked to?

I didn't care much because the problem have finished (even though the money haven't back yet). But, something inside me jolted me like I got a thunderstruck and makes me want to do a simple google check.

And there it was.

The same fucking scam also happened to other people. The same fucking scheme that I got. But from the story that I read, the victim didn't gave their money because they're more aware and careful than me. 

Now my mum's money is gone. I came to her with my head down; my voice trembling; my body lost all senses; and I said to her that I got scammed. 

She just laughed it out and said to me to learn from this experience but that is the problem. This is not the first time I got scammed by using her money. I also got scammed 5 years ago and with my fucking decision, my mum's money was gone.

I'm fucking depressed now. I don't know how to recover from this. This is not just a slap on the wrist of some small mistake for me. My head thinking about all of the decisions upon decisions that I make my whole life since my dad died and I realized that all of them, and I really mean all of them, are bad decision. 

This one event punch me in the face and make me rethink my life back and it made me realize that I can never make a good decision. 

I'm depressed now because I don't think I could move forward from this. I'm afraid that if I move forward, I will make bad decision again. It's better to just end it now rather than I keep hurting the people who doesn't deserve to suffer. But that is also the problem. I'm such a fucking loser that I don't even want to kill myself. I don't know what to do anymore. Living seemed hopeless; death seemed stupid; and not doing anything absolutely means there's no reason to live anymore.

Last thing a depressed person needs is to see other depressed people suffering. Fuck it, I'll throw my agony in the cauldron too, may it appease the unappreciated 

I've been depressed for four years. Maybe longer. I wanted to log back into reddit to perhaps cheer myself up. This isn't even my account, I just know this guy's password. I feel foggy and numb. I've been stuck at home for a couple of months, and my only excuse to get out from time to time has been removed. I'll probably spend the next three to five years in a sort of pseudo prison, where I have total freedom to explore the outside world, but no ability to do so. Confined to my house or at the very least my neighbourhood. I have no right to be depressed. Others are in pain because life is hard, or nature is cruel, or some other fucking atrocity which I can't even begin to comprehend. I, on the other hand, am a spoiled brat who had a childhood which is barely even worth considering painful compared to those around me. All my pleasures are superficial at best now. No work I do can be pleasing because put it plainly I'm not doing any work. I've allowed myself to become complacent, and now I'm addicted to this agony. In the beginning of all this I remember the last coherent thought I had was ""don't ignore this"". That's the last time I heard my own inner voice before I wandered off into blank nothingness. I can't even bring myself to commit suicide, the prospect of death does nothing to bring me even the slightest relief. If I pull the trigger, I'll just cease existing. The pain won't stop, I will. I'm lonely. Nobody can understand what I'm going through because it's too pathetic. ""Oh, you're depressed because of unresolved trauma, or a culmination of cultural pressures, or maybe you lost someone"" no, I'm depressed because I'm too stuck up to accept the good things I'm given. Because I'm so fucking used to getting what I want that I can't accept that my needs are incompatible with that. I shunned a top tier education because I felt like the curriculum was ""suffocating"". Like as if learning is somehow a bad thing because it's in a field I didn't envision myself in. And when I'm given a choice as if to say ""fine, if you don't want that, what DO you want"", I'm left stuttering and trying to change the subject. I want to be treated like a prince who can have everything in the world at the snap of his fingers. My delusions of grandeur and my fantasies of ideals are all I'm capable of understanding. There's nothing left of me that I can treasure. I used to think I had a great intellect, but clearly that is not the case seeing as I'm only able to stagnate rather than pursue anything even remotely stimulating and my powers of analysis have been collecting dust for so long they're useless. I have no creativity, just mimicry of things I blatantly disrespect. I have nothing to show for myself being a human being, and I've nothing I find worthy of cultivation. There's so much I've lost which I was meant to hold on to, and so much I hold on to which I need to throw away

1bhxj7s,Moralsiz_,1,0.0,1710785517,depression,"Just unlucky, i guess (dumb rant) I'm 15M. Turning 16 really soon. I have been feeling really empty since forever. I was mostly fine with it since it was just how i felt all the time. It didn't bother me much until people started pointing out how ""messed up"" my life was.

I wasn't born into a great family. My parents are gambling addicts. There's never money left. They gamble it all away and spend it on cigs. There isn't much income to begin with. My dad works minimum wage and my mom does not work. He gambled away our house money when I was little. We live on rent. The crazy inflation in my country does not help either. They ask for money from me (I don't get allowance. It's just money i hide around when relatives visit and stuff) to buy food. I end up handing it over since I need to eat too. I really just wsnt to work as a cashier or something so I can make my own money. It really sucks to depend on them. I can't have anything. One time he chased me with a kitchen knife, they almost got divorced (not because of that) but they ""made up"" because we didnt really have a place to stay. They argue day and night. It's nothing new now. It doesnt really affect me much, I just worry about my mom. I'm just kind of jealous of those people who don't have any of those problems. They have a nice family enviroment and they get the stuff they want. I can't help but envy them.

That was a lot of rambling, I'll talk about different stuff. I used to do really good at school. I would get all the perfect scores and was the top of my class until i kept switching schools because of their marriage. I'm failing most of my classes. People have so high expectations from me  because I used to do good. I wish I hadn't. I feel like a disappointment to people, which I think I am. Just now I have so many unfinished assignments that are due so soon. I haven't even started them because I'm so fucking tired. I don't want to get out of bed. I still have to shave and shower for school. My exams are starting on top of that, which I know won't pass them because I can't pay attention to any of the classes. I either fall asleep due to rolling in bed until morning and barely getting any sleep or losing myself in thoughts. I really frequently have suicidal thoughts. I've been having them since so long ago so I'm used to it. I always imagine myself taking the easy way out like jumping down from the top floor or whatever is available in that moment but it doesn't bother me in the slightest since I know I won't do it. I'm way too much of a coward to actually commit suicide. But that started to change lately. This is the closest I've gotten committing to it. I never really considered myself depressed or something. I never understood how i felt. I always kept myself busy with other people's problems and never thought about mine. I never spoke about how I felt to anyone. I know they wouldn't care. Especially my family. I never went to the therapist or something since nobody knew. So I never got diagnosed with anything.  

Well recently I really felt like I needed some sort of help. For the first time I talked about how I felt to my boyfriend (long distance). (LGBT stuff is heavily despised in my country, hence being an islamic country) since he was one of the only people I trusted and cared for. He just kept saying he would like to help but doesnt know how and that he had other plans. I know he doesn't have to deal with my shit but it just made me so sad. I always gave it my all to cheer him up when he was feeling down. I just felt... used. I think it was better when I kept stuff to myself. I didn't have anyone else to talk to. I tried joining communities and stuff but none of it worked. I don't even use Reddit. I just wanted someone to listen to me and actually care. 

Anyways, after all that rant I'll just get back to my ""fine"" self and get ready for tomorrow. I really don't wanna go to school or get out of bed in general but yeah, just gotta make it to friday one more time, so I can lay on my bed all day long once again."

1bhvsw1,Sea-Vast-6509,1,0.0,1710781353,depression,"Dont know where to go TW:SA In my late 20s and recently have started therapy because of the stress that ive been going through from a number of things. basically things compounding to the point that i feel like i cant function properly anymore. Ive shut down and even the part of my brain that wants to take care of myself isnt working. I feel like a shell of my former self.  And discovering the cause of that has been hard. Therapy has lead me to do a lot of reflecting.

During this time I rediscovered horrific trauma that i have been repressing for some time:



When i was younger (about 10 y/o) i would babysit for a family friend from time to time. The kids ages were around 5 and 6 (hard for me to remember exactly) We were all play wrestling, and at point i became erect and began to grind on the younger girl while both of us were fully clothed. I had no idea what i was doing. Immediately that night i felt disgusted and i knew that i had done something wrong. I had never learned about sex from an adult. My first introduction to sex was being shown porn by teenagers when i was around the age of 7, and being asked if i was erect and told to show them through my pants.

It wasnt until i was about 18 y/o when i first recalled this happening. I had repressed it since that night as a little boy and I went into the most horrific panic attack and completely dissociated from my self. I was absolutely disgusted and horrified. I couldnt fall asleep for days. I couldnt believe that the person i became could have done something like that. I did not want to exist in the body of a person who acted like that. It caused me to give up completely on myself and everything i was pursuing in life. And again that just led me to shut down and repress all the things i was feeling, because thats the only way i was every taught to deal with feelings. 

Now today, over 15 years later after looking back on my life, ive realized the depression, and stress, and lack of a will to live has all been sprouted from the fact i still subconsciously think of myself as an evil, horrible, disgusting human being for what i did to that little girl. Im not even sure if its a memory they have rediscovered yet either. All i ever feel is that i ruined that persons childhood and possibly their whole early life to this day. And the thought of that makes me lose sleep every single night. No matter where ive gone in life or what ive done since then, no matter how much i know that i am not that little boy anymore and ive grown in to a loving and caring man who could never think of acting like that again, i cant see myself any different no matter how hard i try. I just continue to feel like this is something that is completely irredeemable.

I have never spoken or written about this until now, but ive been trying to build up the courage to tell my therapist this week. I felt like i had to get it out before i would even be able to speak about it with someone. I just dont know what to do with myself anymore and thought someone here might be able to offer some type of help for me

Fast forward to today: seeing a psychologist alone was not enough, and it's starting to really affect my work so I think that I don't have a choice anymore. To those that tried medication:

(1) How long/hard was the adaptation?
(2) What side efffects did you feel, and most importantly, did the benefits outweight the bad?
(3) Any other input about this medication would be appreciated, since I'm very reluctant to try it.

1bhuugi,Final-Standard-5103,1,0.0,1710779051,depression,"counselling stagnant I went through a traumatic event a year ago, was under duress for 9 months before being completely bed-ridden and in constant panic attacks. This was when I decided to do something about my stressors.

The past 3 months I have had to stop school, move out of my dorm, in with my cousin and work part-time to cover living costs. After my crisis era, I have reached a stagnant point in counselling.

I seem to be unable to communicate my feelings as well as in the past, there are just a lot of pauses in my 1hr sessions. The more I think about my thoughts and feelings as suggested by CBT, the more convoluted my life and affect seem.

Was wondering if anyone reached this point in therapy/counselling before? Am i just lazy to work through my issues? Or is it i am bad at talking?"
1bhus5y,Live_While_8924,1,0.0,1710778892,depression,"20F & in need of support/advice For the last year or so, I've struggled with feelings of depersonalization. I often find myself feeling fake, like I could make some irrational choice (ex. drop out of school, run my car off the road and total it, end my relationships in my life and never look back) as if it wouldn't effect anything because my life is fake and therefore my choices don't mean anything. I've struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression for many years and briefly saw a therapist, but I haven't been back to therapy since covid and I moved away for school. I'm majoring in a program I enjoy and also work a part time job that checks all my boxes, but I find myself so miserable going to class or even going in for a simple 4 hour shift at work. I will do everything in my power to not go and I will stress myself sick about participating in normal adult things, but then I'm usually fine when I actually attend class/a shift at work.

It is so impossible to get myself up to do anything, and recently returning from a spring break trip has made me consider ending my life as the only way to escape how unreal everything feels. I don't think I'd actually hurt myself, but every time I have an intrusive thought about ending my life or dropping out, etc., it gets more real every time. I also feel intensely alone a lot, even when I'm surrounded by love and support in my life. 

I know this is not a normal feeling, because telling my friends about it only earns me weird looks in response. Can anyone help me determine what this could be? I'm attempting to see a therapist again, and I'd like to have some knowledge about what is potentially going on with me so I can start looking for help in the right direction."

Im new on reddit so i dont know if i am in the right community to be posting this, but i just wanted to have a somewhere to at least right about this.

Since 2020 (pandemic) my life has chances a lot, i ended up discovering that i have anxiety and maladaptative daydreaming, most of the time i caught myself just standing still in front of my bed and wishing i could just stay there, thinking of how i could make myself a lil bit less lonely sometimes.

Last year i was pretty much doing good in life, i met so many nice people and i was doing so well in school, i felt that this experience recovered me from what i experienced in 2022, where i studied in a school where children mocked me because i was not good looking and pretty much anti social.

But this year i ended up having to change school, and it seems like it is becoming even worse. 

The people in here reminds me so much of that school, they act like 12 years old kids who creates problems just to get attention. Recently one of my friends got pissed of at me because the guy he likes for some reason likes me, and now hes trying to annoy me, even though e feel slightly unconfortable since once i was harassed by my cousin.

Aside from that, these two guys were my only friends in this school, and now theyre fighting and i dont wanna stand on any of the sites because both of them were wrong, the guy who is mad at me because his crush doesnt like he back, and the other one had no attention during childhood and now he became 100% dependent on me.

Those things have been making myself even more scared of the future, i dont know if everything is going to be okay or if i will have to change schools again or iff i will be alone again, i dont mind being by myself, but i feel wrong, i feel like im not living my life as a normal teenager as i was supposed to be, i dont have the have interests as anyone and i dont understand anything about dating, love, kissing and partes, i dont feel like i want to do any of these things. The only people i cant actually count on are my mom, dad, grandma, brother and two friends.

I feel scared of what is going to come, i dont know if i am being the way i am ""supposed"" to be, i feel like im losing myself and i cant understand what people my age are talking about. Im scared of going to school because any wrong step i take can make me become hated by everyone, i just really wanted to everything be fine in the end. I know i should not think to much about this, but whenever something bad happens in my life i cant stop thinking about that and wishing that everything different, i just wanted that things would be calm for once."

Sometimes life kicks your ass, I battled forever. But eventually the strongest soldiers fall. It wasn’t no one’s fault. Don’t feel like you could of done more. It’s my fault. That’s just how depression is. sometimes I want people just to ask me how I’m doing but when they do, I push them away.

It might sound hypocritical but just be there for someone you think is going through depression. Sometimes actually being there for someone even if they don’t know how to talk about it, just take them out. Because it’s better then being home alone when them thoughts creep in.

I’ve applied to over 700 jobs, got a few interviews, and zero offers. It’s difficult for a lot of folks who are in my field but a lot have been able to find work. I’ve been driving Uber for the last 6 months and I’m thankful for it but there’s something kind of demeaning driving around strangers in your personal vehicle. I honestly don’t see the point of living, I’m not saying I was to kms but nothing feels worth living for. I’m met with cruelty from my family when trying to get emotional support, a majority of my friends are in relationships and/or having babies, I have no job, no money, no prospects. Just me and my toy dog. I feel so bad for my dog, he deserves someone that’s more energetic and joyful. I ended a situationship 3 weeks ago, and today I realized that I was nothing more than sex for him and that he just said things to make it seem like I was getting emotional intimacy. I just don’t really see there being a point anymore. I feel like less of myself more and more each day. I can barely even look into the mirror because I don’t recognize the person staring back at me.

1bmccbo,ExtrovertInSolitude,2,0.0,1711254772,depression,"Its okay if you haven't figured out life yet. You aren't alone. I know it gets heavy sometimes.. Life takes the most unexpected turn and you are left wondering if its really worth waking up the next day. Sometimes, the person closest to you ends up betraying you.. Sometimes, you fail in something you were working so hard for.. Sometimes, life doesnt make sense at all.. No matter how much you try making things go your way, life hands you trouble one after another.. 
Trust me, I know how it feels to be surrounded by people yet feel lonely. You have to mask yourself and put on a fake smile so you dont have to explain how you are actually feeling . You feel like no one really understands you and they all surround you to get something from you and for their own selfishness. Its as if you are drifting away from this world and entering your own zone where no one really wants you for you. You try to convince yourself that people actually enjoy being with you but its as if you could smell their intentions from afar, your mind leads you to believe no one really cares about you just because one or two people betrayed your feelings.. I know the feeling of not being able to depend on anyone..
Trust me, I know how it feels like when you are betrayed and you dont get what you were trying so hard to fight for.. You cry yourself out and there is not a single night that you feel good about yourself.. This constant fear of failure and constant feeling of loneliness is turning you into someone you are not..
You feel the same dont you? This is a reminder that you arent alone with thoughts like that.. This makes two of us now imagine how many people are feeling the same? 
This is a reminder for you that not everyone is here to betray your feelings, some people want to change you and your life for good like your family.. dont let one person change your whole perspective on everybody..
This is a reminder that one or two failures from your hard-work isnt the end of your journey, its just a lesson to improve on what you are doing and focus on goals rather than results..
This is a reminder that you are doing great and you will get whatever you asked for- a good relationship, a healthy family and a successful life..
Till then, keep on searching, dont give up, you will find your worth soon, you arent alone in this journey."

He is quite a rebellious, he always protests towards our parents as he was pursuing his own career and it turns out it was a success. I am an IT student... I envied my brother so much. He has a girlfriend who supports when I am just a single sore loser. 

My brother and me are pretty close but every stupid mistake I did, my parents really choose to scold my brother instead of me. I get a little scolding when them both are putting their anger to my big brother.

I feel guilty... I couldnt save it because I am so afraid as I kept trying to say that it was me who did a stupid mistake.

 I was so egoistic causing all of my savings gone and my father trusted me to keep it saved.

I kept lying and lying for months about my finance situation trying to ensure that everything is okay... but I cant hold it to keep lying as I confessed thinking that he isnt going to get mad since he says so. Turns out I was wrong... and He was terribly angry.

I deserve what I did.... but I always wonder... why should I live when my existence only bring people sadness... My existence only bring my family a disappointment. Why should I live ? I dont want to kill myself... but Why should I live ? I hate bringing others in pain because of my stupid mistakes.

Mainly emotionally abusive parents (dealing with since I could remember), really shitty job and university I’m trying to juggle while dealing with the above.

I’m also trying to heal from a really toxic breakup, tldr summer of 2023 got ganged up by his guy friends and kicked me out of the shared house we were living in, and forcibly moved me back with my parents despite knowing the ongoing issues I’ve had with them. If I move out again they will disown me, which isn’t financially viable for me due to rent prices being high and lack of a good job market.

I’ve been working a retail job for the past 3 years to financially support myself, my university funds and my family. This job has been the most soul draining experience and every shift is constantly making my depression worse and worse…I feel the life force slowly coming out of me. My father became partially disabled due to a stroke at the time I got kicked out, so I’ve been the main contributor for money now and the only one working out of my parents and two younger siblings 

My job requires a lot of walking/standing long hours, physical labour and customer service as I’m put to work in multiple departments (this is in a superstore), and always scheduled by myself so it’s been extremely hard physically and mentally with overwhelming tasks put on me despite being only 1 person . I also live in a small suburb, so finding another job with my qualifications and being a student has proven difficult and I haven’t been able to find one suitable, but I’m still trying to this day, my job search hasn’t ended yet.

Today was my breaking point, I told my dad I’ve been having a really shitty week at work and all he told me was I should be grateful I even have a job, and that I’m working the lowest of the low jobs. Insulted my job, and told me I’m comparable to slave workers back home…just really out of pocket stuff which broke me today. I can’t stop crying in bed and I feel incredibly stuck and hopeless. 

All I’ve been doing is helping my family, providing for them and especially helping my dad so hearing that from him upset me a lot, especially since this job has been so taxing on me. I can’t even function at home after a shift and end up sleeping the rest of the day. and since this job is the highest paying for me right now I haven’t been able to quit in fear of not being able to find another job for a long time due to the horrible job market. 

Juggling with the other things mentioned above has sucked the life force out of me and I feel so broken. I don’t know how to keep moving forward in time for exams. Please help me. I wrote this on a whim so I’m sorry if it’s all over the place. I already talk to a therapist but due to her caseload I can only get sessions every 5 weeks under my benefits. "

She'll start arguments over the stupidest things and start yelling at us. And often times when she does this, she always says ""You're just like your father."" who was abusive, stole stuff from us,  yelled at us, and threatened to harm, and kill us many times. me and none of my siblings are like that.

She also used to yell at me over very pointless and small things when I was very young. She also somewhat recently let one of her old friends into our house because she wanted a boyfriend. Because the first abusive one wasn't enough. The reason it was careless and shows she doesn't care for our safety is because, she knew he had a drinking and smoking addiction, was beaten as a child, and was very mentally ill. but she still decided to bring him into our home. And big surprise, he yelled at us all over nothing, threatened to kill me in my sleep, and out of nowhere when I was playing videogames with my brother, said to us: ""Do you guys watch pornography?"" When I stopped talking to my mom because of how toxic I was she tried to make me look crazy by saying I'm mentally ill. Which is so manipulative sounding. I just don't know what to do. I need to talk to her because I live with her. And I also need stuff like an ID, a drivers license and other things. I want to get out of the house and stop talking to her as soon as possible, because I can't stand it anymore. I wanted to ask if I should ever talk to her again if she changes, but I don't think she will.

For the past few years I've built my personality on lies, trying to tell myself that I'm okay and I got stuck with that personality, an endless cycle of denial. Recently I started to feel better about life, myself, my surroundings etc. But, there's this feeling that has been constantly popping in ny head. Who will I be when I get better? I mean my whole personality, myself, my life, it's all built on me trying to lie to myself. Now i'm scared that when I'lk get better, I won't know what to do. I'm scared that I won't be fitting anymore. As the personality I've created isn't actually real me. And I'm scared I won't be able to keep up with this. That I won't know who I am.

Lately she and I constantly butt heads to the point where I have stopped telling her what's happening in my life. This is a painful boundary for me as I used to tell her everything. We've tried family therapy in the past, and it didn't work. I think she's taking out things on me that are not from me.

I'm recovering from a breakup with a situationship who has been like a best friend to me these last few months, but ultimately didn't treat me with respect or kindness, and seems unbothered with the course of events. I'm also dealing with the fallout in our mutual friendships and feeling forced to let go in some pretty big ways.

Wherever I go, the pain is there with me and it's been really hard to maintain my self-esteem and take care of myself and the new relationships that I want to form.

I'm feeling stripped of support and skinless, and every little prick and stab from the world sends me spiraling with no one to turn to. I wish someone would kneel beside my crumpled, crying form and hold me, but having a hard time letting anyone in or believing that I'm worthy of a supportive love right now.

My mother has meds but doesn't take them so she goes insane when she doesn't. Throughout my childhood (i'm 14, 15 in 3 months) i've been physically, mentally, sexually and emotionally abused my mulitple people. My dad left when I was young, my mother and step father you already know about, and my grandfather is incredibly annoyed all the time and creepy.    


I moved out of my mums house (See my acc for more info) during feburary, well, she kicked me out then took it back a few hours later but i didn't go back. I don’t know, ig I'm just extremely stressed. Like EXTREMELY. I know I'm just about to ramble so bare with me. My gran doesn’t honestly understand anything and she doesn’t understand that just because she doesn’t feel emotions, other people can. She doesn’t get how stressed I am because of the whole ‘moving out of my mum’s house’ situation and she thinks it’s nothing. I tried talking to her about how trauma is real but she thinks and says I should just grow up and stop being sensitive. She keeps disregarding everything. I asked her why she keeps brushing over everything that my mum’s done to me and she said “We’ve all had bad things done to us, we just have to get over it”. I hate it so much. I can’t talk about anything around her. She doesn’t believe in therapy or anything like that. I can’t live with anyone. I can’t like with my mum because she’s absolutely insane and fucking abusive, and my step dad is weird and creepy af. I can’t stay at my grans house because of everything I just said, and my grandfather is too much like my mum, or, I guess, the other way around. But he’s creepy too, and gets annoyed over everything. And he gets drunk all the time, ect. (Same with my step dad). I can’t live with my dad even though he’s the only one who gets anything because of his family and my stepmom. School isn’t much better. All the classes, teachers/teacher changes, street area and the fucking option-timetable choices shit are stressing me out. I’m getting really annoyed at everything and I’m petrified that I might start taking it out on my friends, who honestly, annoy the living shit outta me and they really arent't good friends tbh.  I really just wanna do online school but again, my gran doesn’t believe in that. I can’t stop thinking about everything over and over again. I keep having nightmares and I just keep freezing over every little movement someone makes. I just hate everything and I’m so tired of everything. I don’t wanna live with anyone, I just wanna live by myself and stay away from everyone forever. Apartenly, according to my gran, my mum is either “worse than me” and I need to “Be nice to her” because i’m the bad one, or i’m “Just like my mum” and “have to grow up and stop acting like an insane bitch”. I hate this. My mum is most of the time always worse than me and I’m the bad one for having feelings. I just wanna go on holiday and relax for a while but i can’t because my mum needs a holiday and it wouldn’t be fair if I went on one and she didn’t, but at the same time, I can’t be in the same room with her, nevermind a holiday. And I’m just dreading the easter/summer holidays because everyone’s going on holiday, and no one wants to hang out because they’re busy. Not that I blame them of course.

1bm57jo,Prestigious_War2448,3,0.0,1711233773,depression,"(24) M I can't live in this toxic environment  Almost three years ago, I moved into my grandmother's house. I was in a low place, this was before I was diagnosed with any mental illness. I was no longer self-supportive, and my family agreed to help me. It has been a very heartbreaking journey getting my life together. I claimed bankruptcy, had my car repossessed, and ran into legal trouble. I've had a job for the last two years, occasionally taking time off because I had to be admitted to the hospital four times for mental health issues. The last time, I was given Haldol and it turned out I was allergic. I had major side effects including anxiety, insomnia, depression, akathisia (feeling agitated and restless inside causing uncontrollable movements that offer no relief). My face and shoulder muscles would lock up, and I couldn't move. I pleaded with my ""doctor"" to take me off, but he kept saying this is what I needed, so I continued to take it, causing more intense side effects and reactions. Their solution was injecting me twice a day with more Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl, and Cogentin. I wasn't able to refuse the medication because they threatened me with refusing discharge until I complied with my treatment. I was discharged after 12 days and had to go to the emergency room three times that week from side effects I was still having from the Haldol. They finally put it in my file that I'm allergic. I was told the Haldol would be out of my system within six months. I went to three different psychologists over the last six months for help with the damage that drug did to me. Now, I still have uncontrollable movements and bad anxiety. My grandmother belives the symptoms are psychological, and reminds me constantly dispite three doctors saying otherwise My family isn't very understanding when it comes to mental illness, and it has caused a lot of problems. 

Things are changing for me now. My debts are paid off, I have my license back, I completed my probation, and I take my medication properly. I do not use drugs. Aside from my family, living situation, and transportation, I am the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I have an amazing girlfriend who has been there for me and supported me, and I love her son. He's five years old; his father is absent in his life, besides a facetime call once every few months. He's such a good kid, and I know what that feels like. I want to be there in his life and I want to begin our future together, but I cannot move in with them or afford a new apartment for the three of us. 

It has gotten to a point where my grandmother and I's relationship is close to being damaged beyond repair. I am not innocent, but I have suffered and worked my ass off to correct my mistakes. It's not healthy to constantly be looked at suspiciously; I'm constantly being treated as a burden (yes, I have been told I was to my face). It makes me feel horrible to bother anyone; it made me very antisocial, and now there's an issue with me just keeping to myself. I'm accused of things I didn't do constantly. I am treated like a child; my location is tracked, and there are notifications when I leave my house. I am not allowed pretty much anywhere without my family besides my girlfriend's or work. I'm being threatened with being sent to another facility even though I've passed drug tests and am taking my medication. I have no money saved because I have been giving 90% of my pay to my grandmother. I do not own a car, and my credit is very poor still. 

I have until Monday, the 25th, to find a new home or be sent to another institution. I'm not sure what to do; any advice would be great."

He strung me along for two years while dating someone else, wouldn’t let me go, and ultimately came crying to me about how he missed me and wasn’t over me, and then three weeks later said, jk I love my girlfriend. Needless to say, it made my mental health go down the toilet further and make me feel unloveable and worthless again when I was finally doing better.

Dating has been horrible. So many bad dates. The pickings are so slim that at this point I am entertaining men I’m not attracted to, because at least this singular guy is smitten with me, is nice to me, does not make me feel horrible. 

Everytime I do get a huge crush on a guy, turns out he’s married (great). 

I feel like I will never find anyone. It feels so unfair my ex got to immediately fall into love again after us, refused to let me go, and also refused to choose me. I fear I will never get a chance at being a mother.

And before you say it, I do think I’m cute. Heck I think I’m pretty! And smart! And so damn funny! So no, I really don’t understand why this has become my life.

1bm4xjl,Scared_Juggernaut333,1,2.0,1711233033,depression,"Is there a psychological explanation for this experience? Basically, since a young teen I believed I was worthless and should be punished for my existence. That I was the lowest of the low and everyone was above. I wasn't allowed to feel anger towards anyone or anything. Everything that went wrong in my life I would blame on myself even when logically I knew it couldn't have been my fault, I would find a way to blame myself. If my friend hurt my feelings, I would tell myself it was my fault because I deserved it, or that I was too sensitive or dramatic, and that I should be grateful to be their friend...  
And this anger would build until it was extreme and I would take it out on myself, punish myself. I wouldn't let myself hang out with people because I believed I would make their lives worse by being there. I didn't think I deserved to feel good because I was a terrible person and there was nothing good about me and I didn't deserve life but had to stay just because it would inconvenience people if I wasn't here, and death would mean I didn't have to suffer and I deserved to suffer. I was so upset all the time but when I cried I would punish myself for crying because I didn't deserve to cry since I should be grateful as I wasn't even going through anything and everything I was sad about was my own fault.  
I struggled with restricting and other physical behaviours which I 'had' to do when I felt sad to 'prove' I was struggling. Then I would end up binge eating which I would punish myself for. I didn't think I deserved support because 1. I was a bad person and 2. I was making everything up.  
I thought about ways I would physically be able to get help so that I had a reason to deserve kindness. Anytime someone was kind to me I had to punish myself because it meant I had manipulated them into thinking I deserved to be treated nicely. Sometimes I felt so much emotional pain it felt physical and I would internally beg for the suffering to end but then the other part of me would tell me I was being dramatic and nothing was wrong. I would walk in dangerous areas at night because I believed I deserved something bad to happen to me. I felt no punishment would justify what a terrible person I was.  
I limited myself from opportunities, I stopped doing things I enjoyed not because I didn't enjoy them but because I thought I didn't deserve to enjoy them and was ruining things for others by being there. I didn't put any work into my future because I didn't think I was capable of anything at all. I would even restrict sleep and water to punish myself for continuing to live a 'normal' life. Anytime I was complimented I felt such rage towards myself because I was so angry that those compliments couldn't be true. I wanted so badly to be anybody else, someone worthy of love.  
I wanted to do the things I loved so badly but I wouldn't let myself. I knew what I needed to do to be happy but I wasn't allowed. I told myself nobody cared about me, and then I'd feel sad that nobody did and then I'd get angry that I was sad over something that I deserved. I had rules like I always had to put others first and if I didn't then I had to be punished. It was like I was in an abusive relationship with myself.  
I was diagnosed with depression a few years later but I don't think it fits. From what I've read on depression the thought process is more like 'I feel so sad, nothing makes me happy. I wish it would stop. I don't want to be here, I need help.' not 'I feel so sad, no I don't I'm lying for attention. I should feel worse, I deserve to feel worse. I don't deserve help'. I've spent years trying to work out if there's an explanation or why I felt this way but I can't? Does anyone have a name for this experience or an explanation for why it could occur?"

Shortly after I turned 16, we found out my dad had been cheating on my mom for a while. The person he was seeing's daughter found our house phone number and called us to tell us where he was because she didn't like him. At 18, I watched someone I liked a great deal walk away on graduation night and realized I had gone the whole school year without even making an attempt. Just shy of 21, I was ghosted by someone I thought was a friend and who I saw as the older brother I didn't have growing up. The next couple of years I just don't remember at all. Then I got my dog, an all white husky and I loved that dog. Unfortunately she died 3 and a half years ago and the age of 8. They found a mass on her liver and she didn't make it through surgery. The same year she died I found a job that was tolerable. It was a small local restaurant, and I liked the people I worked for and with. I was there for 2 years. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, the owner had to close it down. I thought they were going to re-open, they even had me help remodel the restaurant a bit. I had to find out from someone I worked with that they changed plans and weren't re-opening and had rented the space out to other people. I have no interest in marriage or kids, and no long term plans for work. I have realized that I will never get to visit any of the places I would like to. Even if somehow I manage to make it to retirement it doesn't matter.

My closest friend moved away for university two towns over to a place with much more investment and much more to do, as a result I have spent a lot of time there recently and made a lot of semi-close friendships there through this closest friend, but that friend has now got a partner meaning I no longer have a place to stay when I go up there and if I go out I have to leave while everyone else is still enjoying themselves. (Them getting a partner has left me a bit worse for wear; I value platonic relationships a lot more than romantic ones and I’ve gone through the cycle of forming a close relationship with someone who then gets a partner and has less time for me leaving me feeling abandoned many times)  It makes me feel invisible, like my presence isn’t necessary and that they’d all be just as happy without me there, and also because I don’t live there I’m not able to develop that same level of closeness with these friends as they do with each other, which makes me feel like putting effort into the friendships is pointless. It’s also really hard to find people who want to spend time doing things that aren’t alcohol-based activities, and as a person who dislikes drinking culture and going out this puts another barrier on me being able to nourish these friendships. I think alcohol is a trigger for my depressive mood swings and suicidal ideations (shocking since alcohol is a depressant) but when in this situations there’s a societal feeling of peer pressure that leads me to drink and then break down and beat myself up for it. There was a time around 6-9 months ago when I would be so overjoyed with going out everyday to see people, because I enjoyed the people and I enjoyed the environment, and now I’m just withdrawn mentally - I can’t see a point in going out to see people whom I’m not exactly fully close with / can’t fully be myself around and to be in drinking environments I don’t really want to be in at all; since things are lined up for me to leave this town in September I don’t see any worth in entertaining this friendships that I know are just gonna fall apart when I move. 

Speaking of the move, it’s obviously good on one hand to get away from here but I’ll be moving to a new place again, starting over again, in a completely different part of the country once again, and this is filling me with uneasy and uncertainty which makes me want to draw back, because even though this place is absolute hell it’s a hell I know and I’m used to, and so many things could go right when I move but so many things could also go wrong - I may not be able to find new friendships and new people I can be myself around again, and I feel like I should just kill myself to spare future me the anguish, even though I know I have people around me who love and care about me and I’m sure I’m overthinking this whole thing. I’ve never really had a support system around me locally before and I feel like it’s all crumbling and I’m terrified for that and I’ve ended up pulling away from them)

1bm3thb,Grigo_Rix,1,0.0,1711230181,depression,"Success has robbed my ‘why’  I’ve always been a very goal oriented, disciplined and ambitious person. Depression was something I’ve felt happens to people who experience severe hardship not those who succeed in what many would consider the pursuit of happiness. 

After university I didn’t get the job I wanted. But took that as extra motivation and after 3 years did achieve what I always saw myself doing: a suit and tie job at a prestigious firm. As a junior starting out it meant long hours, proving yourself and beating others in an up or out culture. As a senior the work load only grew and the weeks, months and years were stressful but rewarding. I’ve learned a lot and grew to genuinely like my job and get quite good at it. The success came as being recognized as one of the global top achievers for multiple years in a row. Which came with a promotion, salary increases and bonuses. Allowing me to pay off my student debt, buy a nice house in a good neighborhood and afford a luxury car. Besides work I got married to my best friend. My wife is amazing. Equally ambitious, intelligent and strikingly beautiful. We have two dogs and our home life is great. 

In short: I’m exactly where I pictured myself to be in my 40’s but in reality most days I feel empty and don’t see the why or the purpose of living. My thoughts are extremely negative all the time. Nothing is ever good enough. My mood swings are constant and all over the place. At work I’ve mostly perfected a professional ‘mask’. Which I want to let go at home but then feel like my bad vibes are effecting my wife and I don’t want her to start feeling bad as well. So I don’t really have anywhere to go with this as most of my friends and family feel that I should be grateful with all I’ve got and achieved in life. Adding to the shame and guilt I feel by not feeling any joy about it at all. 

I’ve tried multiple psychologists in the past as well as mental health aid from the hospital and been diagnosed as depressed. The professionals were never able to help me because of being in their joint opinion a highly functional person without a direct external cause for the depression such as work or family life. Which left me feeling even more misunderstood and alone. As asking for help to begin with was a major hurdle for me to overcome in the first place. The final solution were anti depression pills after I began developing suicidal tendencies. They were horrible and make you feel like an empty shell. Dulling all negative emotions, but also anything positive. I’m still here though so I guess I should give the pills some credit. 

Currently off medications and much better in control of recognizing flare-ups in my depression. But unsure how much longer I can keep this up. With the negative thoughts and no sense of direction I feel like I’m losing the battle against my own mind. Also, I feel terrible for being this way and for my wife to be around me. I want to be the better husband she deserves but am at a loss as to how. 

Just wanted to vent this here. Thank you for reading. "

1bm2lt6,Signal_tb_2341,1,0.0,1711227129,depression,"Depression progressing - unusual hallucinations  A close relative has had major depression for several years now. It's been pretty severe, including suicidal periods. He currently is on ssris. (Unfortunately only started those when things got really bad. Went many years entirety untreated. They don't really work well. He's not as suicidal as he have been, but that's basically all. ) All that time he had big time sleeping issues. Either sleeping for 20h or being awake for sometimes 2-3 nights in a row unable to fall asleep. Periodically with intense hyper real nightmares. In those nightmares he would recurringly see three creatures. He'd be in a dark, hellish basement like place, together with them. They speak a language he can't understand but he sorta telepathically knows they are talking about evil, death and hell. And even tho they do not physically threaten him he feels extreme anxiety and helplessness facing them. Perfectly aware this is a dream, he is yet unable to wake up even when he panics and feels his heartbeat going through the roof. 
Not too long ago the nightmares mostly stopped. But then he started having more panic attacks in real life. He says, he feels it coming and then all senses feel enhanced, hearing and seeing especially. Everything is super loud and sharp. And then the panic attack comes. Often he starts shaking and can't speak or move. Often this aphatic shaking state remains for an hour or even several hours. Often he has no memory whatsoever of those. For example he went on a trip with his wife, got one of those attacs entering the plane and doesn't not remember flying, riding the bus, checking in, about 5 hours, just erased from memory. 

Recently he started having hallucinations being awake. He sees the beings from his nightmares clearly together with him in the room. Being wide awake. It's not shadows. He can see them very clear. He isn't affraid of them anymore. They do not try to kill or severely harm him. But they do tease him, touch him, annoy him and laugh about it. They do not speak to him. He can hear them speak to each other though in a language he can't understand. He says, it's impossible to ignore them, and even though they don't threaten him, the teasing is very annoying and whenever he encounters them, on top of all, it feels like they suck the energy out of him. As soon as the visions are over he is so weak, ha can't move or speak and falls asleep on the spot.

Whenever I read about psychotic depression people say it's auditory hallucinations or shadows and that the voices or figures talk to them about suicide or worthlessness. But his hallucinations do not seem to fit that theme. Also whenever he has those visions he is aware of them being hallucinations (it feels real but he knows they are not. Probably because they are creatures that do not resemble people or animals in the real world). 
Has anyone had similar experiences? 
What helped? Certain pills? Certain type of therapy? I'm trying to help but no one really understands what's going on and we don't know where to start.

1bm39oi,xixi_journals,8,0.0,1711228791,depression,"Life is unfortunately no fairytale People hold a lot of secrets and they are so great at it to the point where you'd think that it was just human nature. Me on the other hand I hold my secrets because I have no one I can tell. Loneliness it's like a plague that infest the most broken people. You know they tell you that when you get older your friends start to decrease but it's never for certain. When it comes to me it was inevitable because unfortunately I was one of those broken people. Sometimes I ask myself is it better to be lonely and surrounded by people who will never really know you or is it better to be lonely and have no one. I feel like I spend my days wasting time and waiting and waiting and waiting but I'm not sure what I'm waiting for.  
Am I waiting to be happy? Am I waiting for something to change? Am I waiting for my depression and anxiety to become a thing of the past? Am I waiting for me to change? Or am I waiting for my death? I've never been afraid of it, death that is. In fact I've only been fascinated by it. Sometimes I wish I was a kid who got more hugs and who heard their say they love them. But this is real life and it's not a fairy tale so there's no Prince charming coming to save me and I have to save myself. The only question is how. So I ask myself how to end up like this and how did I end up here. I need to leave here in order for me to thrive in order for me to live. Here is torture, here is pain, here is a constant reminder of I am the why I am. But here is supposed to be home, here was supposed to be the place where I feel safe in the world. But it's not because like I said this is real life and this is no fairy tale for me. Sometimes I wish it was though because then would be easier to be the girl locked in a tower and the handsome knight who's probably white comes and saves her but I would have to be white as well and I would have to have the blonde hair, not nappy nigga hair and blue eyes not the brown ones. My story was already tainted from the beginning not to say that my life made any easier. I'm so tired of saving myself and I'm so tired of fighting for me and I'm so tired of forgiving people after they hurt me and I'm so tired of being me. It's so easy for people to judge each other because they don't walk in the same shoes and they don't see the same views but I wish that I was not different from you. When I think of my future I don't see a happy ending, I see years of healing and years of finding myself and years of learning to love myself. I'm currently in the process of college, working, looking for an apartment, losing weight, fixing my eating disorder, taking medicines for my depression, anxiety and whatever else, paying my debt, working on learning to speak up, fixing my physical health, fixing my life patterns, finding myself and etc. And somehow in the process of all of that I'm supposed to love myself. If I said I give up then I look like the bad guy or the girl who died because she couldn't take it or the girl who left her whole family and loved ones behind or just another statistic. There aren't enough words to explain, to comprehend and to say, that would express how exhausted and drained and depressed I truly am. So yea there's no good ending to this story I'm just a human being, who's broken and lost nothing new."

20F here, recently got off prozac about 5 weeks ago to treat anxiety and it had a really bad adverse effect on me instead. i got very emotionally blunt, i was crying all the time, had a couple days where i literally couldn’t get out of bed. i had no motivation to do ANYTHING— school, work, i isolated myself, and worst of all i lost my relationship. 

i went from being very happy with my ex to feeling like i didn’t love them at all, and if i did then it wasn’t more than like a friend. i felt weird, distant, and like i didn’t want to be around them, when the night before i had a great day with them and we celebrated our 6 month anniversary. i still feel this way, a month after our breakup, but my depression has gotten a little better. 

we’ve decided to stay friends until otherwise, because i enjoy them and i want them in my life. we had a beautiful, happy relationship that was very healthy, and it all went to shit literally overnight. i’m at a point where i know that my mood and my feelings are a huge factor into why i started feeling this way, but there’s no other reason to why i’m feeling this way. 

right now my goal is to try and feel more like
myself, but i feel so stuck in one spot because i’m desperately trying to figure out if i still have feelings for him or not. i feel like it’s the only thing i can focus on right now and i don’t know why. if i really didn’t love him anymore, why would i be so caught up in trying to find out what’s wrong with me?

more important info: this HAS happened before, but four years ago when i was 16. i had been dating my first boyfriend for a year and a half give or take. i was completely fine one day and anxious about loving him the next. in his case, it did go away, and i felt fine about him afterwards, but i’ve gone back and forth about it for the two months this has been happening. 

is this because i’ve been depressed, or have a i fallen out of love with him? a combination of both? maybe i just left the honeymoon phase and now i have no motivation to continue a relationship because of my depression. i have no clue anymore :’)

similar stories/situations very very welcome!

tl;dr — my relationship either ended because i stopped loving my ex, or because I’ll depressed, or who knows maybe a combination of both.

I never was a particularly happy person but last year has been rough on my mental health and something I'm experiencing now (that I haven't experienced during other low points in my life) is that I don't truly feel like myself anymore. May be because while I turned 23, I haven't accomplished any of the goals I thought I would accomplish at that age. I feel like I was the happiest at 21 y/o (22 sucked, 23 will either suck or be the start of recovery. Or both)

I used to be passionate about books and movies (now mostly apathetic), excited to learn sewing and knitting (now I get annoyed and frustrated), loved long walks in nature (now I only go to get some fresh air and physical activity, it's like a chore). Even music doesn't bring me joy anymore, I just use it (on headphones) to tune out noises like the neighbors talking too loudly or the sounds of roadwork outside.

It's not only mental stuff. I lost weight because of my bad eating habits and while I've never considered myself beautiful now I actually kind of hate how my face looks and how some of my clothing looks visibly too baggy. That's not the face I've grown used to seeing in the mirror over the years. I actually started eating regularly and cooking nutritional meals because of that so I guess that's one positive thing.

I grew up in an abusive household and after a month of dating he moved me in with him and out of my house to ""get me away from that life"". My dad se\*ual abused me when I was younger and my parents fought all the time and I was looking for any way out. Everyday since then has been constant fighting and the only way I've delt with it is by dissociating. The second I start to think about how real this all is and the impact of what he has done I get extremely depressed. I stay up late to have alone time, I work an shifts when he has days off so I don't have to see him. I have no friends because he accuses me of cheating and flirting with everyone. 

I'm leaving him in 55 days and the closer it gets the more real everything feels. I don't want to eat, I don't want to work, I don't want to sleep. I'm anxious all the time because I know he knows he's losing control of me. All the things I've managed to do while being abused (working regularly, getting good grades, taking care of myself) are suddenly so hard for me. 

I'm so close to getting my freedom back and I've never felt more trapped. 

I feel so stupid. I should've seen the signs before we got together. The drinking problem, our age gap, his mood swings. 

I feel so worthless. How could I ever let myself get treated like this? Especially when I went through 18 years of abuse from my dad? How could I have not seen the signs?

Nothing feels worth it anymore. I have so many things to look forward to after I leave him and none of them excite me. I'll have freedom for the first time in my life.

1blxq96,Independent-Froyo455,2,1.0,1711214988,depression,"Depressed person ignoring me, but not others? Hi r/depression - I (23M) have known this girl for some years (22F), and our relationship started off on the internet. When we talked online before we met, she always seemed happy, interested and seemingly had a crush on me, as did I with her. First time we met she seemed just as she always had, but this quickly changed a few days after our first date, and she started ignoring my messages. 

When I asked her about it, she told me she didn’t mean to hurt me, but that she was isolating a lot and wasn’t ready to be in a relationship, because she was suffering from depression and didn’t feel anything for me or anything else in general - I told her that I understood, and despite being in love with her just wanted her in my life and as such was fine with just being friends at the moment, and to support her however I can, which she agreed to. Since then she mostly still keeps ignoring me however, and whenever she texts me it’s always very short and dry. I don’t really care much about texting in general, but it really makes me anxious when she ignores me for more than a week sometimes and won’t answer on if she wants to do something together, because I know she meets up with friends and texts them etc., and it makes me overthink a lot, in specific that she is just trying to ghost me, since I seem to be the only one who gets this treatment AFAIK

I don’t recall me doing this when I was depressed myself, so I’m curious as to if this is something any of you can relate to and if so what causes this for you, or if she really is just trying to ghost me, although I’m not in doubt at all that she is depressed. I’m sorry that this post comes off as very egoistical, I really do want to support her however I can, but I am worried about asking her about why she is ignoring me and seeming clingy, and fear what consequences it would have on our relationship - as well as my depression coming back if I don’t try to handle the issue soon, as it really is making me feel ignored and has been messing with my selfworth a lot recently

In advance thanks a lot for any help! :-)

I never thought of them as being traumatic in the moment, but they ruined my perception of reality and what normal things feel like and I haven’t been able to enjoy normalcy. 

   A lot of my first sexual experiences were online with older men when I was a minor, I guess I just didn’t realize how heightened the experience was because I was younger, and because it was so taboo. That started being the only thing that I favor, and now that I’ve been in adult for some time I realize that those experiences are not normal and they’re very heightened in a way that you’re doing something wrong and I’ve noticed that that alone can be a huge sexual attraction just because it’s wrong just because it’s shameful and because you shouldn’t and I didn’t realize that that was a huge factor. Now that everything is not off-limits anymore and I can do whatever I want as far as consensual sexual relations, I don’t feel that attraction anymore. Also getting use to people and experiences. 

   None of it as special or as romantic as I ever thought it’d be. It’s been no more a huge letdown after fantasizing about it, my entire childhood, because it calmed me down and it was one of my only skills as much as that’s not a good thing it’s all I found that worked. 
     Anyway after a few my relationships that went very south and hurt very bad, I was not myself. When I got into my current relationship a year and a half ago I kept expecting to feel a lot more than I ever actually have and I always questioned if it was just me comparing my very heightened experiences to a very normal experience or he’s become too normal to me or if I don’t feel anymore at all. 
      I got very depressed after the last relationship that I was in. Starting this one, I wasn’t on good terms with myself, and I also hadn’t had nearly enough time I needed to heal from my past ex. I had so much joy for that relationship and to learn that it was a lie and of course I was being groomed I just, don’t understand why reality is bitter because it makes me feel more dead inside then when I was being straight up lied to.

      I believed everything and it was blissful and now I live quite the same reality that I was wanting so I got what I wanted, but the emotional connection is not there and as far as relationship problems go, I’ve hit the lottery with them and not because of who I’m with but because of my needs because my partner doesn’t particularly shine in those areas so it takes extra work on top of the long hours he’s already gone. It makes me feel bad for asking so I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve stopped fighting for what I want in the relationship. 
       It doesn’t help that I found out that I was pregnant pretty recently and of course he was way happier about it than I was. But totally looks over the neglect I feel and the depression aspect like the kid is gonna help it go away to an extent. 
     I feel like I’m dying as a person my identity is gone. I’m not sure who I am anymore because my favorite versions of myself are all in the past and I don’t feel like I can be myself the way that I should anymore. I look at myself in the mirror and I’m not proud anymore, I’ve lost interest in nearly everything I’ve ever enjoyed, except for superficial things that remind me of memories that I wish I was having, with lots of love. The only thing that makes me happy is just fantasizing about things that will guarantee physical, emotional and spiritual connection. 
     My partner is the only person that I interact with during most days except for calling my mom or my dad. On days that we are fighting, I have to wait until the next day or the next day after that to get any kind of emotional connection again. I also have no girlfriends and no plans to go back to school. I just kind of sit in the house all day and rot. 
     Some days all I want is to be young again to experience all the best days of my life when my hope was at the highest and my dreams felt more possible and way less scary.

Throwaway account because I don't want to reduce the possibility of the people in my life finding this.

Unsure of why I am even posting this but after 20 years of depression and anxiety, I have let it get to far and I can't escape from it.

I lost my job in the beginning of January, later that month I attempted suicide but couldn't even get that right.

In February I lost my relationship of 11 years because in my stupidity I waited to long to propose and work on myself, not for lack of wanting to though, but actually because I couldn't get past my fear of not being enough.

With the the relationship I lost the home, car, etc.

I'm broke and in debt. This is after working on average 60+ hour weeks for 10 years.

That plus an old illness popping up with full avengeance among other things, I just don't have any fight left in me.

I look in the mirror and see the problem, a burden and a failure. I believe that I am a waste of resources and am now browsing the internet with no will to live left.

More info: I have been on antidepressants (my second time) since January. I called the suicide line in my country today, it didn't help at all. If you're wondering about what I might be planning, the answer is yes.

Sorry if this makes anyone's day heavier. I am lost, have run out of things to try and need to give in to this feeling and let go."

Hi Reddit. I’ve been in depression for the past 12 years. Sometimes things get a bit better depending on the meds I’m taking and the current life circumstances and stress levels. Other times, you know….
My husband is very supportive but no matter how I try to explain things which I admit I probably do in a muddled way at best (how I’m feeling, what I can do and cannot do, etc.) he remains clueless (how can you be depressed? You were fine the other day/ why don’t you do this or that). It is frustrating for both of us and on top of all the rest taking a toll.
Do you know of an article that explains in layman’s terms what depression is and what the sufferers go through?
Of course I tried to find a source but got overwhelmed (ADHD + currently in the deep dark 😞)

I managed to do well in school, got a master's two years ago, and still stuck at my part time job. No friends, no social life, no hobbies or interests.  No career direction - I feel like I did these degrees for nothing sometimes. I feel like I was living someone else's life. I have crippling anxiety, low mood and insecurities and don't have enough to live to move out of my parent's home even if i wanted to. I'm so socially isolated that I've become used to it and I kind of like it now, but it means that going outside is overwhelming. I feel like I did degrees that I ended up not being as passionate about as I thought I would be. I can't plan anything until I have money/a stable job, but I can't find a job. I have so many rejections, failed interviews etc. I am stuck in a cycle that I can't get out of and I feel so ashamed and like a loser. I can't get out of this mindset although I am trying to commit to exercise and hobbies etc and being positive. It's increasingly becoming difficult and I see no way out. I feel like I am wasting my life and I regret almost every decision I've made in my life. I go to sleep with thoughts around death and with this pit in my stomach. I feel like I am reaching the end of my rope sometimes"

My ex was the only good thing to happen to me, the only good relationship I've had in my life and it's gone. The worst part is she moved on pretty fast and her life is so much better than when we were together. I don't get how people can do that. I have no way to make friends or build my life back up.

1blvoin,Amazing_Life_221,3,0.0,1711209784,depression,"Watching “Drive My Car” made me realise many things People are too complex; you can’t understand them. For every decision and every move they make, there are billions of reasons that are unknown to us. The mind has a subconscious which is untapped by any philosophy or science. So don’t even try. But that also means we ourselves are complex. It takes an entire lifetime to resolve and understand these hidden emotions. So let’s be a little brave and admit them as they are, not getting bothered by anything else.

The first thing is to accept life as it is. Accept yourself as you are. Don’t feel guilty even when you have messed up things. Don’t get too low or too high for something you are not part of. You are alone in the end. Life is pointless. You came here alone and you are going to die alone. Yes, even your lover will leave your hand when they bury/cremate you. So admit that you have the sole responsibility. Whatever happens here is because of you and not because of anything else. Acknowledge that you are complex and need time to explain and understand.

Nakakapagod sa mundo. Nakakapagod mag trabaho. Nakakapagod mag isip ng mga bagay-bagay. Nakakapagod na ipaglaban ang nararamdaman mo. Nakakapagod na maging ok kahit hindi naman ok. Nakakapagod yung araw-araw kailangan mo magpanggap para lang maging ok ka. Nakakapagod na maging tao.

Minsan gusto ko rin naman kumalma. Yung walang iniisip na kahit ano. Masaya lang. Gusto ko naman sana yung hindi ako gabi-gabi umiiyak. Gusto ko sana yung parang high school lang ako — masigla, masaya, matatag. 

Hindi katulad ngayon, nakakapagod.

Higit sa lahat, napapagod na akong intindihin ang sarili ko. 

Kung may isang hiling lang ako, siguro kunin na lang ni Lord yung pinahiram niyang buhay sa akin. Kasi nabababoy ko na yung buhay ko. Sobrang walang gana na ako sa buhay. Pagod na rin ako. 

Ok na siguro yung 25 years of existence. Atleast, makakasama ko na ang best friend ko. Hindi ko man alam kung sa langit ang punta ko pero sana kahit once makita ko ang best friend ko.

i am 14. i have no friends, no hobbies, i feel like no one cares about me, and i think it’s all my fault. 

i’m a really angry person. i hate being around people and i hate talking to people, especially as of lately. this includes my family. it’s mostly my family i don’t enjoy being around because all of them have chipped into the reason i hate being me, such as the fact that they have all belittled me and made fun of me since i was a little kid. 

my mom and dad split up when i was 9, and since then i have had issues with both of them. my dad is never around, and when i lived with him, we had a huge argument which resulted in him bodyslamming me and yelling in my face, calling me a bitch and what not. my mom… i am always arguing with her. i love her but i hate the way she talks down to me, even if she is my mother. but i am just always angry with her. 

i always talk back or i just straight up ignore her. i hate upsetting my mom, even if she was never really there for me growing up. sometimes i think my entire family would be better off if i just wasn’t here. the only place i can find comfort is in my room in my bed. i stay there for hours on end, i don’t usually leave my room unless i have to eat or use the bathroom. i haven’t showered in days. 

i’m just really lost. i’m lonely and i’m angry. i have no idea what i’m even doing with my life anymore. i don’t want to kill myself or anything and i’m almost a year clean from self harm. i just feel like nobody cares about me and it’s all my fault, i don’t blame people for not wanting to be around me but i can’t help what i am. i literally can’t. i try to be nice to my family, i really do, but i fear that there’s no helping me. am i just a bad person?"

1bluvdu,Solarr_Prince,0,0.0,1711207758,depression,"My little brother  My mother just told me that she wished I wasn't there and If I wanted to go I could.
It's not the first time she said something like that, it happens a lot and she also told me in the past that if I wanted to die I could.
 
I wish I could, but I have a weakness and it's my little brother.

For context, I am an 18 years old girl, and I have a 10 year old brother. Me and my mother do not have the same view in life. Perhaps because of religion and culture, (she is African), she has a different way of thinking. I am not saying that people of certain religious backgrounds and ethnicity are bad, but you know some cultures put different types of view on people.

When I was twelve I started hurting myself, and the problem is that my mother said that I was acting white and that if I wanted to die I should and could, it's free. She doesn't believe in depression Only when it's here, and she has a lot of negative views on some people because of her religion, which is contradictory because she is supposed to not judge...

When my brother was born, I had to take care of him a lot. I was eight when I had to take care of him at night after school while my mom worked. I know we haven't had the easiest life, I grew up in Congo and it wasn't easy then we went in Europe, Belgium... now we are in France. And  she did worked a lot for us, now I have my own room and a house, I know we were even homeless once, but does that mean I deserve those words?

I started working hard, really hard at school as if giving myself a point in life...I also really love art, which is the only moment I feel happy.. but I feel so hopeless. If it wasn't for my brother, I'd go away, and perhaps I'd let myself die. 

I don't want to leave him alone with her. I'm really tired, all my efforts are worth nothing. I rarely eat, I don't sleep.... Sometimes, I wish my brother didn't exist, because I would be able to go in peace if it wasn't for him.

The worst part is, I feel as if I am not allowed to feel this. I am not allowed to feel sad because people have worse, I am not allowed to feel sad because we have lived worse in the past. I finally have a home and I'm in a pretty free land with good people, I'm not allowed to feel this..

But I do.

1blugmy,throwaway00660066,0,1.0,1711206687,depression,"How to help a friend Hello.
I (23f) dated a guy (23m) for a bit under a year. We were long distance and even though we broke up, I would say our relationship was a really nice one. He opened himself to me since the beginning about his struggles with mental health. It was quite bad. He had suicidal thoughts since a young age because of many things that happened in his teen years: like being badly bullied, girls asking him out as a joke, his parents way of parenting, etc. He grew up to become a really insecure person. While we were dating and after he confessed that he didn’t feel good enough to deserve “someone like me” in his life. 
His parents opinions have always had a big toll on him. From his dad telling him “men do not cry “ “you’re not depressed, your friends are feeding you wrong ideas” “there’s not such as thing as depression” and his mom is quite similar but more on the over protective type. During our relationship both would treat me as a gold digger and his mom would tell him any chance she could get that or relationship was deemed to fail, that he should date other people and I wouldn’t find out, that I’m toxic, that he should date a real European girl (I’m from Latin america) etc. Hearing all this opinions + his insecurities led to our breakup. 

Months later we started talking again as friends, and I came to the realization that his view of relationships has become really worrisome. I always knew he didnt have the right view of what a healthy relationship meant. But it has gotten worse, it was never to this extent. He thinks the only way to be loved is to feel loved by another person (a relationship). He has become obsessed with finding another person, and that if he doesn’t get into a relationship before 30, that means he’s a failure. I asked him what would he do if he’s single by 30, and he admitted he would kill himself. I genuinely didn’t expect that answer. He recently got a crush, and if she rejects him, he will spiral badly again, which I’m 100% it will happen. He gets crushes to fill his lack of self love. Thats also why his friend and I agree that he won’t ever have a healthy relationship till he gets help, he’s sadly really easy to manipulate. To feel loved and included he will follow what any person would say to him. Because of this new mentality is also also why he felt the need to “block me” out of his mind before, cause he started thinking his clock was tickling on getting over our relationship and trying to find another gf before 30 (during a bit after the breakup he became “mean” but later apologized and admitted it was because that’s how he was treated before, and he thought that’s how it was supposed to be)

At least, for this time. I won’t leave him alone. I can’t and I genuinely won’t. I’m the only person he fully trusts to send me messages when he’s feeling bad. And I have no problem with answering to his good morning messages that give him quite comfort. I do think I would obviously love it if eventuality, getting the help he needs, he won’t need as much as reassurance he needs from me.  And will be able of living the life he deserves. He’s not a bad person, but he doesn’t see it himself. He’s great. He genuinely made me really happy, and I’m sure he also makes all of his friends happy too. 

He does have friends that have noticed his bad mental health, however he doesn’t open up to them fully. I would say I know 85% of the situation, while he tells his friends around 30%. Only one of them I would say knows around 60%. He looks at her like a sister. After we broke up I messaged her to please check on him, and now we talk from time to time, not only about my friend but we also just found each other quite nice to talk to. She knows about his struggles, and has always been open to hear him. In general his friends are really nice, and have always tried to comfort him any chance they can, they said they also noticed “something was going on” since the moment they met him. 

Because of how bad his mentality has come, him saying he will kill himself if he doesn’t date till 30. (One month and a half ago he also wrote what would have been his “suicide note”. I only found out later when he confessed he felt bad for having people worried for him, cause he wrote it in the note along with writting that he felt bad for being a baggage for me, I could never see him that way). 

The question is. I don’t know if I should, at least, make his closest friend aware of this. She doesn’t tell him when we talk about him, me neither.  When we talk about him is mostly us checking up on him. If I was living close I would maybe keep it to myself and try to make him get the help he needs on my own, but I don’t live close. His friends (his closest friend) do. They do have suggested him to try get some help and even tried to talk to the uni staff about it. I’m not sure if I should tell his closest friend a better idea of how bad things are getting. Since she, again, lives closer and I think could be of greater help for someone that’s actually physically close to know about it. 

I’ll probably get comments saying to just let him be, and is not my responsibility, but I won’t leave him during this time. 

I recently sent him a care package and it arrived today. So he’ll go to pick it up. From time to time I also send little details. Like a hand warmer, sweets, etc. I don’t want him to forget he’s not alone.
The care package contains: find Waldo images that I printed, origami tutorials and color paper I cut myself, sticker by number that I found of his favourite flower (he also fell into game and porn addiction, and says he’s stuck in this cycle, I gave the suggestion to try hobbies, and he won’t do it till someone gives him all he needs, that why I added that), QR code to fonts that I bought since he studies graphic design, chocolates for his friends and salty treats for him since he doesn’t like sweets, a beanie (he lost the one I gifted him a year ago, and felt really really really bad about it, so I checked multiple stores to find the same one, and I did find it !), good luck charms from my country, etc

I am just becoming more toxic day by day. I also have a problem of perfections that why I think I never did anything in my life , never did anything completely. God has given me no good except more bad. I am too logical. I always procrastinate things. I am too adult for my age and in a bad way(I am not mature like others but kind of old ) . I am too concious of myself and when I make some mistake I immediately start seeing around me if somebody notices me and as I have turned 18 I can see many changes happening in me as a result I am no longer innocent like others like whenever something bad happens around me I am become too much aware of it and it feels very bad while others don't even notice it and remain happy like I used to be before in childhood. Also I don't like sports like others. I have too much dark interests unlike everyone else. Sometimes I think all this is due to me being born in 16 December which is the worse date of the year as I have seen people born in December are worse people neither they look good nor they have talents. I know I may sound stupid here but all this one of my dark interests which I have wasted my life observing.   Why God made me like this . I want to be those normal people who I see everytime make jokes happily going outside doing fun things with each other. I am too different from others. Also I have problems with doing daily chores but nobody has this problem. Sometime I think should I make a baby in my future as he will also suffer like me . I want to die .I did nothing good in my life nothing memorable . Whenever I am in a group I am always seen as very different while others belnd themselves in the group. I am always outcasted. Also seeing too much Google making theories about my insecurities made my life, my mind a hell . Nothing exiteds me now . Nothing feels the same . Am I normal ."

But now recently I started developing feelings for someone and for some reason it makes me feel more depressed than usual. Like I don't want to do shit anymore, lost motivation (altho I somewhat can get it back and 'force it'). Isn't this ridiculous?

Like brushing my teeth, but also drinking and eating. Most days i only manage to Drink something in the morning, because i have to take my ADhd meds. 

My boyfriend really Supports me a lot, comes with me to appointments, cooks nice meals and is really understanding - most times. The reason why im so down is that i lost my job half a month ago, and that Puts even more pressure on our relationship and on me Finding a new one, plus the financial trouble.

Overall we talk a lot about our feelings and i especially try to communicate openly about my depression. i also told him about past traumas, such as me struggling to ask for help. I always feel real ashamed when i have to ask for help and be so vulnerable and i told him about that multiple times. Im Just real sensitive and rarely ask for anything, except im really in need, like needing water. 

I was already really dehydrated, and i asked him while he was already laying in bed. Before that we had talked a bit and snuggled, so He was awake but just real tired. I then asked him, If he could get me a water, and he got really annoyed and complained that he didnt want to get up. I was really hurt by his reaction and didnt know how to respond. 

I went silent and he misunderstood my reaction with being angry, thats when He started getting real Defensive and how He was Just tired and what i expected of him and so on. I got really frustrated and just told him i get it myself, but he He already got up to bring me some water.  I didnt really feel like drinking that, since it was so annoying for him to Help me. 

I just thought he would be more understanding. I feel so hurt and alone with my problems, that its creating a big distance between us. I tried to talk to him and he apologized, but he doesnt get why it was hurting me.

I'm 19 and I'm probably the most apathetic kid at this point. I have no goals, no social life, no desire to do anything. I'm also Muslim and of pakistani decent. I'm addicted to porn and have been since I was 13 , it gives me the littlest drop of dopamine I have to get through the day. I'm a second year in college right now with only 30 credits, no clue what to major in (I went from Electrical Engineering, to Economics, and then transferred to another school that takes 1.5 hours on public transportation). I live in NYC so no way I can drive to my school. I did architecture for a semester and did complete garbage. Now I'm studying Construction management. My dad wants to do Construction after retirement and decided to purse the same degree as me, as well as my cousin. (Crazy right?) Now whenever I say I'm struggling with a class or it seems too hard, he's like ""i work full time and got an A in those classes, so you can do it too"", or ""youre not putting in the effort."" The truth is, fuck this life. Why should i try for anything at this point. I also work part time, and my job requires me to be a full time student, otherwise I have to resign. I withdrew from 3 classes last semester so I am on academic probation from my job. This semester I took some bullshit classes to get my 12 credits and keep my job. But there seems to be no end. I'm miserable, and my parents won't let me take a break from school otherwise I have to move out. I literally have to be in school right now. I've been told ""it doesn't matter if it takes you 10 years you're getting this degree."" I've been asked by my bosses what my hobbies are since they know I'm not doing well in school, and i have no clue how to answer this question. All the money i make goes to paying tuition as I do not get any financial aid. I have no interests or desires to do anything. I'm eventually gonna run out of easy classes to take and stay full time. This is my 3rd time taking calculus and im probably gonna fail again. The only thing I do if I'm not at work or school is in my room and watch porn,  not even because of the attraction anymore, it just gives me some comfort. Or I scroll through Instagram reels.  Ive tried to quit porn many many times, but go back to it after a week at most. Its ramadan and i still fall into this habit after sunset. My dad and uncles and their friends bring up marriage to me and it always pisses me off as I can't and am so depressed to the point where I'm not really attracted to anyone anymore. Why the fuck would I get married right now? I understand it's part of my religion but no way.  If I could get a job where I could make like 55k and never advance and do it the rest of my life, I'd do it. I have so much to say but idk what. 

I'm very shy and anxious too. I don't go anywhere and run from interaction. My only highlight of my day is taking the train to and from school, or the bus. I genuinely wish I had direction, or ambition and definitely a girlfriend, but I'm so empty inside. I had a mental breakdown on March 1st in My living room and cried for the first time in like 3 years in front of my parents, uncle and 3 sisters. I cried for about 5 hours that day. I'm a complete mess right now. Life actually sucks right now. I have nothing, nothing.

1blqcop,Throwawayforanony7,1,1.0,1711194618,depression,"I haven't left the house in months I'm 17 and female. A few months ago I dropped out of sixth form because my mother was concerned about me. I was getting picked on and wasn't being social enough, i couldn't get any work done due to inability to concerntrate and lack of any motivation. I now stay inside all day and have an addiction to shitty imageboards, fanfiction sites, discord, and reddit. Whenever i scroll i feel like a part of my brain is wasting away yet i can't stop. I keep my curtains shut so i don't have to see what's going on outside as i might start wanting to go out or feel like i'm missing something. I have no friends irl and only interact with people online for discord game jams, fantasy anime leauge and anime discussion on imageboards. I can't even play online games with voice chat because the idea of speaking to people through audio makes me feel horribly sick and lightheaded. I spent my 17th birthday crying alone quietly because i'm one year closer to having to get up and take responsibility for things which i never want to do. I hate interacting with people who aren't my family because they all backstab you and think they know what's best for you and I have no real interest in anything they have to say. I've grown to much prefer characters and concepts because they cant change suddenly, or be snarky. I also hate the responsibility of having to speak to someone daily as it makes me feel burnt out pretty much instantly plus i struggle with giving people advice and generally understanding them. I've ended up pushing away so many people because socialisation makes me extremely exhausted. Theres no point in having friends if i grow to dislike being around them or get burnt out and can't hang out. For the good of the other person i just push them away.

I hope you, the reader, are understanding how big of an issue this is for me. I'll probably be forced to return to school in september but i will certainly end up dropping out again. I don't even have any sort of job i want to do, or special talent. My routine is wake up, go online, eat lunch with my family, go online, eat dinner with my family, go online until 4am then go to bed. I'd really like to die, as i'm just spending my life sitting alone without much career purpose. If i can't find a career in future I'll just kill myself as punishment for being a leech on society.

I can't go to a therapist because my mother refuses to let me do anything like that and ""doesnt want"" me ""to be that kind of person"".

My main focus for now should be to go outside but it's really terrifiying. I'm worried i'll see people. Plus i live nearby a secondary school and seeing teenagers and kids makes me feel ill, especially when they're in large groups."

Almost a year ago I finally got back to work after being at home for a few months due to my depression. I slowly came back to living my life, having fun and maintaining my hobbies. I was so happy, I thought I had overcome depression. I knew it won't be gone for ever, but as the winter depression didn't catch me this time I was really optimistic.

But here I am, sitting on my couch. Cuddled into blankets, having a hundred tasks to be done, questioning if my earlier much loved hobby is still my hobby as I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't know when I showered the last time. 
If I weren't with people yesterday I won't have eaten anything besides the chocolate next to me. But I gained weight, I'm sad. The package I really need to send stands patiently in my kitchen. I already send it but I came back and I'm overwhelmed. I have to be more careful this time. But it's expensive and complicated. I don't want that anymore.

I'm reflecting how I lived my life the last weeks ... And now I see all the little signs which tried to tell me ""Caution! Depression incoming! Be careful."" But I ran past them. Directly into ✨the depression ✨.

At the point, I was struggling with coming out with my family, financial constraints and rentals. I constantly felt trapped and helpless, and had been suicidal for 3 months on end. Because of past trauma, my girlfriend was one of a few people who could relate to me. I could reach out to her for sympathy, understanding. She was both a listening ear and someone to bounce off ideas for solutions.

Before I asked her out, I made it a point to start therapy because I did not want my gf to be doing all the emotional labour in this relationship and picking after my slack.

My therapist did caution me against starting a relationship given how I had been going through countless changes and am need of time to settle down and adapt to my own life. However, I just went ahead with the confession thinking that I did not want to miss out the beautiful things in life.

Recently I have had a lot of improvements in processing my trauma, but whenever I shared it with my gf, it would be taken as misery instead of strides. For example, I was sharing with her today how past few nights I could not sleep because I was up re-examining how tough it was for me back in school while I was still closeted. I did not allow myself space and time to acknowledge how hard it was until 7 years later because only now I am safe enough to actually relive those moments.

We don't have the best of relationships and because of that I wonder around outside no matter the weather. Sometimes I walk 30km a day and doing so I drink quite a lot. 

I also continue writing girls that have rejected me and which dont respond to my texts. I really dont get myself right now and am feeling uneasy and extremely stupid. I really hate myself. I have a therapist and also take Venlafaxin 225mg. 

Is there anything I can do to feel better?

Thanks in advance!"

Im going to a clinic next weeks, for like 3 weeks internally and then the program lasts for 4 or more weeks, but I can sleep at home.
I need someone to talk to, I love my friends but they are worried. I can't be completely honest with them. Is there anyone who wants to talk or like maybe make a group and talk about depression and we can give each other support? 
Also I am so scared to go to the clinic I've never been there before.

1blm900,tamarindtequila,1,0.0,1711177987,depression,"A r/askreddit post made me realize I have depression, but I think it’s not too bad yet… now what? Background: I am 23 F. I graduated college with an engineering degree & got married spring of 2033. I now work a desk job doing a lot of environmental government paperwork and it is boring. Fine for now but not for the forever. Not sure what next steps are. Hubby & I plan on no kids till 30.

I was scrolling reddit mindlessly, aimlessly, & read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/yNMAilPtCj) (r/depression does not allow cross posts). It made me realize I am depressed. 

I thought I was depression proof. I started douloxotine for anxiety Fall 2023 & have already had my dosage increased. It helps with racing thoughts so much. It works much better than Zoloft, which I tried previously. I thought that I was depression proof because I was on anti-depressants.

When I wasn’t on them, I would ball my eyes out for hours, want to die, self-harm, etc. Now that I’m on them, I do none of those things! My husband is much less stressed too, because I am stable.

I mean… I do feel barely motivated to do work, eat healthy nurishing food, excercise, go to work, see family, see friends, cook, play videogames… I just kinda scroll Reddit now & go down rabbit holes. It’s… fine. I feel like I barely noticed 1/4 of 2024 go past. But to be fair, I didn’t have any motivation for those things when I was sobbing all the time so it’s not like I’m “worse” now.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/yNMAilPtCj) made me realize I am depressed. What now? I’m not too deep, it’s more of an “apathetic” depression. I can’t afford to go back to therapy right now, although I have some great techniques I learned from EMDR that help me calm down.

Help me for a game plan for next week to get un-depressed. I will post updates here & hold myself to it, because I’m not emotionally out of control. 

If I were to start, I would be 
- that I need to start drinking (at least) 2 of my 40oz bottles of water per day.

P.S. My job has A LOT of flexibility - which is great - except that I am really falling behind because of all of this. I have trouble getting up in the morning, time management, distraction, motivation, etc. 

tl;dr: A Reddit post made me realized I am a little depressed even though I am on a high dose of anti depressants that work. I need a game plan. How should I approach next week on a productive way that will help me get out of this rut? I will be making a game plan and will hold myself to posting updates for a week."

I honestly don’t know what got inside my head but food doesn’t interest me anymore and the thought of putting anything in my mouth disgusts me.


I constantly check my weight and consciously count the calories I consume each day. I start the day with cornflakes and yogurt, and that’s the only thing I can eat without feeling guilty. I don’t think about lunch and dinner; I let the days go by, thinking I’ve eaten enough already. My stomach grumbles, but my head is convinced as if I've eaten enough for the day. I have hyperthyroidism now because I've been overdosing on thyroid meds (helps me lose around 0.5-1.0 kg a day)
Without them, my body starts to act weirdly (anxiety and body tremors).

While I’m not intentionally behaving erratically or faking it as this has been a constant for the past 10-11 months.. I’ve lost 15 kgs since and so I’m not sure if this is serious or if I’m delusional thinking I’ve got ED?

Also conscious that i might have mental health issues.. nothing feels right anymore. I have friends and activities that I could keep myself occupied with but I choose to do none of that shit and rot in bed the whole day. Do I think about ending my life? Yes. But can I go through with it? No, because I know I have people around me whom I would hurt… but if I had the chance to give away my life to someone who deserves it even less than I do, I'd gladly do it because I believe they would see it as a second chance. I hate contemplating the future and dreading the next day, wondering how I'll manage to get through it…

1blpc8s,Few_Emergency_4506,1,0.0,1711190816,depression,"How do I overcome this? 28M, lonely and possibly depressed I'm currently battling a bout of loneliness for the first time in my life. I have been living away from my family for over two years now, they only live half an hour away but I've never felt emotionally safe to express myself around my parents, except to my brother - who is very busy with work lately and I don't have time to talk to him.

1. I just changed jobs, from a hybrid situation where I got to see my colleagues in the office two days a week - to a job where I need to work a night shift with remote colleagues who work in a timezone with a 15 hour difference. Confined to my home 5 days a week with no physical interaction.

2. In the past two years of living away from my family, at least I've still had housemates. First was my cousin, then my ex girlfriend. When my ex and I broke up, she lived in my house for another 8 months till she found a place of her own. I'm now living in a 3-bedroom apartment fully on my own, with nobody to talk to and a boring job that keeps me at my desk. It pays alright and I have more time to hit the gym, so that's my only consolation.

3. I find myself in a blossoming new relationship in the last two months, but my girlfriend is long-distance. We Facetime nearly everyday, but she's normally exhausted after a long day at her work and will be coming back to my city (her home city) in a couple of weeks. Besides her, I have nothing else to be excited about in my life. I know how important self-love is, and to not rely on one person for happiness, so this is not at all a good thing.

4. My old friends have all grown apart, and I am forcing myself to maintain ties with them by having random catch-ups, going out for drinks, or just texting them to say hi. But I can sense that they're either not interested in entertaining me or simply too busy with their own lives. I regret taking for granted the years when I was close to them, to not forge a stronger bond over time. I say this because I feel that most of my friendships have expired since we don't share similar interests/experiences/humour anymore like we used to, and the only ""friends"" I relate to are now the people I work with.

5. I have started going for therapy but it's not been convincing. I need to talk to people who understand me well, and the only people who can - are my brother and my ex. My brother is too busy and when I tried talking to my ex (we're on good terms, platonically), she's always going off about her new boyfriend and of course I'm not keen to listen to my ex about the person she replaced me with.


I know that I'm not alone, and that many others are battling the same things here, if not worse. For the record, I AM NOT SUICIDAL, not at all. But I do cry myself to sleep on some nights.

It was never like this, I used to be full of life in my late-teens and early-20s. People knew me for being the one who brings others together and always has my OWN shit together. I'm known for being independent, intelligent, financially responsible, and very stoic. I'm too afraid to come clean to anyone and ruin that perfect image that they have of me.

I would just like to know what I can do to overcome this heavy feeling in my heart, what hobbies can I pick up, and how others have dealt with the same."

man their is si much i want to do to explore the world around me so so much i wanna meet new people go out with my friends meet new friends have different experiences but my muslim parents make it so so hard. 

so i’m already not allowed to go out a lot. a few days ago i was supposed to go to the mosque after class for iftar (break fast of ramadan) with my friend, but we stopped by her house bc she needed to get ready. my mom wanted to pick me up and drop me so i could go later to the mosque again. but i told my parents that my friend could drive me there and they kept on calling and messaging me the whole time when i was at her house asking where i am because i have my location on. 

once she was done getting ready, we were able to leave and picked up a few more people to go to the mosque with us. my parents kept on calling me while we were picking people up and asking me where i am and i kept on telling them the same thing over and over. i sent them the link of the mosque and my dad said he’s going to pick me up. i was rlly confused because i was going to the MOSQUE. once me and my friends reached the mosque my dad was already there waiting to pick me up and it was just bc the mosque had different islamic beliefs and my dad called them non muslims like dawg i just wanted the free food and then i would go home but idk that was so crazy for me. 

like imagine ur friend drives u somewhere to hangout and your dad shows up to pick u up before u two are able to even hangout 

and it’s hard because their strictness makes me feel very lonely and strengthens my social anxiety. which i am trying very hard to get rid of because there is so much so much i wanna do. i literally used to be suicidal because of how sheltered i was

1blmdka,Accomplished-Wave-91,1,1.0,1711178512,depression,"I'm afraid of my growing lack of empathy Not sure if this is even depression itself but it sure started when that popped up.

I feel like these days I've been feeling less and less able to feel bad for people, it started small. My siblings would get injured doing something and I wouldn't be able to feel any really pity to what happened to them, but I put that up to me just being tired of their stupidity.

Then last year my grandmother died, and yeah we weren't seriously close but annoys me that I wasn't even able to shed one tear, hell I couldn't even try and look sad for my mother.

Today my sister fainted in front of me and by the time we got her to wake up all I couldn't really do is make fun of her bad sleeping habits.

I recognize that this sounds edgy as hell, almost like 14 again but this is really starting to worry me. Through out of these events all I can think about is how they have never looked this sad about my situation or felt this bad when they caused me emotional turmoil and I can help and feel emotionally exhausted from all of it.

Of course I'm not a trained therapist or something so maybe this is some kind of repression idk."
1blm7ny,Less-Ad-2224,1,5.0,1711177832,depression,"Why am I always the stupidest person ever no matter where I go? No matter what, everyone else is smarter than me. Better than me. More talented than me. Has a brighter future than me. I am a piece of shit no matter what. 

They say ""don't compare"" ""Focus on yourself"" well what if I'm literally worse than everyone else. What if I have literally nothing, NOTHING, good about me. Those quotes just makes me feel even more of a loser since it proves the point that I just don't have anything.

It is easy to prove why I am so stupid to. Smart people are confident with what they believe, they can solve problems on their own. They are capable of showing others how great of a human being they are (and good for them, smart people deserve the recognition) and therefore can easily get others to praise them constantly.

 I on the other hand is not even close. I am never confident in my beliefs, always doubting my logic or reasoning since I can never be 100% sure (whereas others are clearly 100% sure since they can boast so confidently without hesitation). I can't always solve things on my own and often have to rely on other's aid, which makes me pathetic. I am incapable of showing off myself so I end up staying quiet and not talk much. Therefore others all think I'm a worthless piece of trash as well"

Idk if I am having a crisis or getting depressed, I still don’t know what this is about but okay here is a bit about me, I am 24, I’m a pretty girl that comes from a really good family, I’ve had it almost all, my dad spoils me often because I am his only daughter he really is the best and very patient with me because I have been rebellious. I have escaped my house. I have done so many things that my parents wouldn’t even imagine… like for example drugs, dated way older men, I’ve stayed out late partied for like a whole week, benders etc. I’ve lived a crazy life specially when I went away for college in NYC and when I lived in Paris. My parents did not know everything I was doing. They did know that I was drinking and they suspected I had a problem but I’d always denied it. I promised I was going to change I did change but eventually I always keep going back to those habits of mine which is being chaotic, doing things for the plot and I really like the party scene a lot. and now I’m 24 and I don’t feel like I have any purpose in life I don’t work (my dad never forced me to btw) because he takes care of me but I feel bad about that too and all I’ve ever wanted is to get married and have kids basically be a housewife because I don’t wanna work and it’s very hard to find a good man these days. I don’t know what I should do like sometimes I am in between either starting a career like start working and just have a normal life like my parents want me to or just go back to New York, go off the rails and live the life I was living before like a rockstar like partying every night sleeping all day spending money doing drugs and just repeat. So it’s either the right path or the wrong path but is it even worth it? To try? Life keeps getting worse these days, these generation sucks, men suck so idk. I’m conflicted and ai feel lost. sometimes I wish there was special someone who would just tell me they would fix me and would be there for me and then I wouldn’t have to worry about all this.

1bllptx,CasperioSydney,7,0.0,1711175821,depression,"Hit rock bottom, no friends, severe depression I've been suffering from severe depression for over a year. I'm feeling suicidal and hopeless..  
  
Last year, I hit rock bottom and everything fell apart.  
  
It all started when I made the biggest mistake of my life. I was working in a very stressful job and it impacted my mental health so badly and it started taking a toll on my physical health as well and I decided to quit. After quitting my job, I continued working as a freelancer and took a leap of faith to start my own business despite having no savings. I used my credit cards and my sole trader income tax to fund my business, I worked very hard and did everything I could and I failed.. and now I'm left with credit card debts with a high interest and tax debt which I'm struggling to pay since I'm drowning in credit card debts. This is the root cause of my depression.  
  
And then my girlfriend of 5 years left me as I was financially unstable.. I don't blame her.. she deserves someone better and stable. After the breakup, my depressions got so much worse. She was my first love, we lived together for 4 years, and it was the only serious relationship I had.  
Shortly after, I got into an accident and broke my right leg, had to get a surgery, and I couldn't walk for months.  
  
And then, my best friend of 10 years (and my only friend) who has always been there since we were teenagers ended up dating my ex. I'm completely shattered and we haven't talked again since.. this guy is literally the only person I had left in my life (I have family but they are all back home, I'm an immigrant overseas). I don't know if could ever make a new friend with such a strong bond like I had with this guy, or even make a new friend in general.  
  
Due to this series of f\*\*ked up events, I'm so broken and messed up in the head now.  
I'm 30 y/o, with 38k in debt, have no friends and no social life whatsoever. I'm still working as a freelancer so I just work from home and have no colleagues, literally 0 human interaction.  
I tried to get a debt consolidation loan because the credit card interest rate is brutal (23%) so I wanted to get a debt consolidation loan at least with a lower interest rate it would be much more manageable, but didn't get approved because I'm working as a freelancer and I have no assets. I tried everything but there seems to be no way out..  
  
I just feel so tired of living this way.. I used to be such a happy person... and now I feel like I've been in the darkness for so long that I don't even remember the last time I felt happy, like genuinely smiling and laughing, it's been so so long :( and I really miss that feeling. And now I'm carrying so much mental burdens and I started having suicidal thoughts and it really scares me.. I wish I could just sleep and never wake up again.. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on this like this.. I'm just so.. exhausted..."

I dropped out of highschool and things downward spiraled into extreme isolation. I was never an ambitious kid. It wasn't until I suffered severe humiliation by one of my family members that I began to push myself forward. I got busy but was always a bit off mentally. I would do embarrassing things that were deemed awkward. I had a horrible time communicating. All those years I spent away from society came back to hurt me. Although I got through it, I find myself in limerence. Somehow unable to believe anything is real.  In a way I am lonely. I miss the rotting stage where I could just pretend I had no responsibilities. Sometimes although I feel so much love for my family and friends, a switch goes off and I hate everyone. I always feel like nobody understands me. I still feel like I'm at the cusp of reaching adulthood despite being so behind. I never had a real solid job. In a way I am scared. Scared of never living and working endlessly to distract myself. I know I should be happy to have accomplished so much but I feel so detached.

Meanwhile, it seems like so many introverts who would be fine being alone 24/7 have so many friends and people who love them. The worst part? They don't have to try. Sometimes, they even complain about how many friends they have. 

This makes me want to die. I can't make a single friend or anyone who cares about me, so what's the point? The only thing I can think of now is killing myself. Maybe that will make people care for a week or two. Maybe they'll even feel a bit guiltly.

I’m never going to a. get hired for or b. be able to perform a job that’s more difficult than my job now (doesn’t pay much)”. I just feel apathetic towards a lot of things and the only reason I’m still going is because I have too much anxiety to stop. just thinking about my situation getting better is so tiring and it just seems like too much effort to actually live the life I want (wanted?) to live. I also keep thinking about how there were so many resources wasted on me and how I don’t deserve to live because of certain health conditions I have (among other things) and how I wish I could transfer all of that to a healthy person so that it is not just a waste of food, money, and a college degree. 

but I keep thinking about things I could do to prep people for when I’m gone, possible ways of doing it, and what their reactions would be. timing too - do I drift away slowly and hope no one really notices? should I stage it as a runaway? do I actually just run away and try to start a new life? I just can’t stop picturing a world that I am no longer apart of. sometimes when I do things, I randomly think about how this might be the last time I do them and the quote I heard about, “one time you do something or see someone will be the last, but at the time you probably won’t know it”. sometimes I feel apathetic, but sometimes I feel genuinely sad.

I never told her how I felt. It’s too late now because she doesn’t even remember who I am. Which is understandable because we literally only talked one time. She also lives states away from me. I met her on Omegle when I was 14. Over a week after my birthday. I turn 16 in 2 months. We talked for probably an hour about all kinds of stuff. I even remember some things. She talked about Indiana because she lives there and about how some former Colts players children lived in a house in her neighborhood. I talked to her about Philadelphia because I live about an hour away from there. I can’t remember all that much unfortunately. But around the end of the conversation. She had the best smile I’ve ever seen. She said “you’re cute”. I didn’t really respond because at the time I had no idea I was in love yet. She then gave me her Instagram and left quickly because her dad came home. I messaged her the next day saying “Hi it’s me from Omegle”. She never responded or read the message. But I was able to figure out she didn’t really use Instagram at the time because she only had a few post and wasn’t online. But I guess she forgot about me since she never thought to check the next day. Still not knowing I was in love, I shrugged it off and moved on till about a few weeks later. I was scrolling through her posts and  I had a weird feeling I never felt before. Deep down I knew I was in love, but I kept denying it to myself because I didn’t want love at the time. Till eventually that “weird feeling” became strong love. Life felt amazing for the first time in a long time. I never had the courage to try and message her again, I just looked at her pictures all day and listened to music. Sometime around February I think, I had the courage to do it. I said “It’s been awhile since we talked, you probably don’t even remember me”. This time, she actually responded almost instantly. She responded with the most hurtful word ever. “ok”. I was just in shock. I never responded and don’t plan to. I just dropped my phone and walked away from it. For the first time ever, I felt my heart sink and break. It was around 7pm and it was a school night so I got a shower. I remember actually hitting the floor and crying saying quietly “I love her”. So cringe of me. I was mentally broken for a very long time I can’t remember how long. But eventually, I actually got over it. Till sometime in early 2023 I’d say. I was looking through my old messages and saw our conversation. And guess what happened? Yup, back in love. It’s now March 23rd, 2024 and I haven’t gone a single day without thinking about her. She started posting again all kinds of pictures with her and friends. Earlier this month, I couldn’t handle it anymore. I made like 4 or 5 portraits of her in like 2 hours with text saying how much I love her. I know what area she lives in, her school, her sport, her friends, her parents names and photos, even her grandmother. I looked through every social media app known to man and found a couple more apps she uses. I have filled my camera roll with like 70 photos of her recently. I used google maps to see how far of a drive it is from my house to her area. It’s about 11 hours. I have debated many times running away to see her, but I never will of course. I have become a complete stalker. I have lost myself worse than ever this time. I also don’t fear she won’t like me, it just because she lives so far away. I’m not bragging I swear but I’m not an ugly person. I’ve been asked out many times but I never liked them back. I also learned she’s in a grade higher than me. I’m a freshmen and she’s a sophomore. Only because I was held back when I was younger because I didn’t do my work as a kid. We would have been in the same grade. But it’s not a huge difference. I’ve also been having really bad thoughts of ending my life over her. I am so pathetic I know. But that’s not the worst part. I had a thought to myself thinking “If I can’t be in love with her, no one can”. I won’t go into detail about this because it still scares me of what my other thoughts were about what I said there. I’ve had so many panic attacks and mental breakdowns over her. I remember about a week after I met her, I told myself I’d never be able to see her. I then had my first ever mental breakdown. Lots of people I feel like would just say to me “It’s just your first love” that is true, but this is almost more than that. Now I’m aware I have never met her in real life, but I know for a fact she is such a great person. I still remember the date, day and time the conversation ended, from my memory. May 27th, 2022 10:34 pm. I’ll never forget this date ever. I really only remember this because I took a screenshot of her Instagram she typed in the chat and the both of us on camera. I can write so much more honestly to this story there’s so much more and it just gets worse to where I am today. I hope someone can try and help me. I’ve tried hotlines and I’m always out on hold for way too long. I hate asking for help, but I’m desperate at this point. I’ve also developed anger issues lately due to all of this. I am also not using my name or anything like that because I don’t want people to recognize me, even though idk anyone who uses this platform that I know. Lots of people look up to me and I don’t want them to see me like this. I’ve got a really bright future ahead of me and a great personality, but none of this matters at the moment. When I think of her, I’m a nobody. Those are only some of my inner thoughts that I have. 
Anyways like I was saying, someone please help me. I don’t want therapy because I don’t want my parents to see who I really have been for the past 2 years. I hope someone can comment. "

Looking at them now, a lot of people were using the app for urgent care...I wasn't so that's why I'm posting this here to find out other experiences with their mental health options.

I signed up, went through the whole thing of downloading the app & talking to the healthcare professional. This was $50 up front. I couldn't tell if the woman I was talking to was AI or not?? She texted me a wall of text after about 30 seconds lol bc I know it had to be copy+paste or AI. That's fine and all, but something was just off, especially when it came to sounding like a real human. All the texts were formatted like chaptgpt lmao. But she had a picture & credentials so who knows.

Anyway she ended up telling me I'm not fit for the program bc my PCP is prescribing me ambien and I can re-enroll later. She didn't even give me the option to tell her I'd be willing to give up the ambien if she was able to prescribe me something else. So basically she told me bye after maybe only 15 minutes.

I take all the blame for wasting my own money, it was my own fault for not reading the reviews. I'm just really trying to find out if sis was AI or not lol

At this point, I don't fucking care. I don't have trauma, I have a loving family, and my whole life I've been a dissapointment who's had everything handed to him. I'm told I'm incredible and almost everything I've done is far beyond what most people my age do, but when you've had so much help along the way, it's no longer an achievement to take pride in, but is just another example of how fucking worthless I am. The only thing I can take pride in is that I listen well to other people's problems, and helping them is the one thing that truly makes me feel some meaning, but it's short lived and honestly fucking trivial, it doesn't fucking matter. I know this is bullshit and stupid, that I have no reason to be doing any of this, but my brain has decided otherwise and any positive self image died years ago, so I really don't fucking care.

Yesterday I filled out one of the DBT diary cards honestly. You know what I really don't understand? Nowhere you go seems to understand that there's a difference between having suicidal ideation thoughts and actively acting on them.

How can I heal if you don't allow me to be honest? And I having those thoughts? Yeah have had them for a very long time. Shortly after I turned 18 I believe.

But if you dare tell any medical professional that they're going to immediately want to toss you in the loony bin or take the liability off of their hands. They approached me after the group therapy was over. And asked me about why I had filled the diary card out the way I did.

And I was honest. I said I have all these feelings in my head and I have no one to talk to about them. Group therapy isn't meant to be individual therapy, they made that clear at the start of class. And my therapist and psychiatrist have all but given up on me. Basically telling me to seek help on my own somewhere else. No I'm not joking.

So I told the group therapist yeah I feel really abandoned. I've got all these thoughts building up in my head and nowhere for them to go. But that doesn't mean I'm going to act on them. I told them I really could use help finding a therapist. It's hard to find the right one and sometimes that takes several tries to find that person that works well with you.

I feel so downhearted. Because as soon as I told them I wasn't a threat to myself and they wouldn't be liable for me feeling the way I am, they just said well very good then be on your way. No regards to what I was asking for. Which was please help me find a new therapist. Is this not a mental health clinic?

So when people say that there is help out there I'm failing to believe it. I mean here I am sticking my neck out asking for help and it seems to me all they care about is liability. Well if she actively hurts herself who's responsible? Well even if I were going to actively hurt myself, I certainly wouldn't tell anybody that. That part just baffles me. Don't most people who have a plan to hurt themselves avoid doing that?

No that is not what I'm doing. I'm asking for help because I don't want to feel this way. But alas I see I am alone. There isn't any help out there that I have found yet. It's hard."

1blejn2,Independent_Mud_3330,1,0.0,1711152802,depression,"My nightmares are affecting my mental health Read this at your own risk, I might be descriptive of some slightly gruesome stuff idk

I have really vivid dreams, I can taste things and remember those tastes like I have eaten that food in real life (I am still looking for a certain kind of bread that tastes similar to one I had in a dream lol), I can smell things and feel breezes and everything and I remember it as long as I remember that part of the dream. But it also means that I feel physical pain, and lately I have been having nightmares about being kidnapped and abused or tortured (or even SA:d), and the torture is not mild. Last night I had three consecutive dreams with the same storyline but I got kidnapped by different people two times and experienced pain in all three. One example of the things that happened in my dream last night was getting holes drilled all the way down to the roots of all my teeth, and although the pain is not on the level it would be in real life, it still hurts really bad. As I remember it, the pain was similar to one I felt during a dentist appointment that left me scared of dentists.

I wake up with no pain in my body, but I become mentally affected. It adds to my distress, and I can imagine the pain when I think about the dreams. It stresses me out and I hate going to sleep knowing that I might get tortured in my dreams again. Ik it might sound dumb or lame but I have no idea where those dreams come from and why I have them, I have had similar dreams for most of what I remember of my life, but never often enough for it to feel like an issue.

I hope these nightmares stop soon, I usually don’t have those when I am not stressed, but they add to my stress and mental weight, and right now sleep is turning into another point of stress for me instead of letting me rest and it is not helping my already unstable mind :/

Just a lil rant, it doesn’t feel like something that can just be fixed but if anyone else experiences this I would love to know, because I feel so alone with it and don’t know how to cope with them

1ble42w,Basic-Middle3043,3,12.0,1711151665,depression,"I am depressed at 13 This is my second time ever really venting, ive tried a therapist but i have to get my parents involved with it so i just didn't. I've been having these thoughts ever since I was around 10-13 and ever sice my parents divorce my depression has become ""active"". 

Around when I was 11 or 12 I had this big group of online friends that lasted 2 years. We had this big minecraft world that we named caca town. I loved everything about, every day I would be so excited to be on talking with them. Then there was this event that ruined everything. This one guy joined and told lies to everyone. No one believed it but after a while it started to get into one of their skins. It dug into them and they didn't know what to think, then he eventually believed it then left. I don't know what happened to him but they said he killed himself. After that ""he""was kicked out for ruining everything. After that I started getting these thoughts about how I could of done more to fix this, how I could of saved him. I still remeber the world like it happened tomorrow. I eventually just pushed all of them away so that I don't ruin their creation any more. My first betrayal was him joining and doing this.

Then at school I had some money that some of my friends knew about. I didn't think anything about it until one of them took it. He wasn't good at lying. It was only 60$ but I knew I should stay away from him. So I pushed him away. My second betrayal.

Then after a while before the second time I had made this other group of online friends. It started out super good. Everything was perfect, it was all I ever wanted. After a while i started to feel off about the new people that joined, but I just thought that It was me thinking about the past, so I let them join. After a while people started going with them. Is my group not fun? Is it me? I don't know. But everyone started to disband. Me and 3 other people were really left. Then it was 2 other. I thought this was all I needed so I didn't really do anything about it. Then one of my friends wanted to talk to the other friend that disbanded, it sounded like he wanted to talk to him, it really did. So i eventually got him to talk to him. This was my worst mistake, this time it was really my fault. He said the worst things to him, telling him about how much he hated him how much he felt like he was a disappointment. I was struck in the heart, my closest friend saying this to him. He was so sad after this. So I pushed every one away, it's the thing I'm best at 😃. I cried myself to sleep that day. Then he talks to me like nothing happened. I'm disgusted at myself and him. My third betrayal.

I  didn't have a good relationship with my mom. I never really did, all she did was work, Water the garden, and was on her phone. She really only took care of us when she has to. There was also these times when my dad told me about things she did in the past, these were hard to believe because she basically was barely in my life. But now I believe about anything bad he says because I heard her talking about the things my dad said about her. My dad tried getting a divorce with her a long time ago but didn't have enough evidence so nothing really happened. Now I just don't really talk to her any more. Everything was going normally. I thought things were gong better. But then my dad told me about something my did a while ago. I won't be telling what he said but I was devastated. How could you not care about us, and do bad things. The divorce is still being figured out but I know where I'm going. I feel disgusted when i talk to her, she's the one person next to me that i want dead. Fourth betrayal?

There is also this other event that was completely my fault but I won't be saying.

All I can think about is how I could have done better, how things could have changed if I did something else. I cared too much, now I don't care about anything.

I'm only alive because of my dad. I love him for taking care of us and loving us. I just can't make him sad by killing myself, I would be such a bigger disappointment then I already am. My siblings also can't have a dead oldest brother, who would they look up too? They cant, they would be looking down at my grave.

Now I'm just pushing everything into my big sad balloon, keeping everything hidden from the people I know. I've spent so long making and designing my sad balloon. But eventually it will pop, because you can never fill a balloon with too much air."

I can’t love myself knowing that my birth served no purpose other than to please my father sexually. I want to die every minute of everyday, even during the happy times in life.

Right now, I'm taking Miravil 50mg for around 3 weeks, not really seeing any good results right now but that's not exactly what I'm worried about. Also, I don't know if it will be of any importance, but before Miravil I was taking another medication, but it also didn't work. 
Anyway, the problem I struggle with right now, other than all the other stuff, is my weird dreaming situation. Lately I've been having really realistic dreams, but I feel like they have gotten worse. After waking up I have no idea if a day passed or not, even if my dream had some bizarre elements, it all feels real. I feel like I can't trust my memories, I also feel a bit detached from reality.
Is it anything serious? Should I tell my psychiatrist? Did anyone of you struggle with something similar, and if so, was it anything serious? (not asking you to diagnose me, just curious about the causes for other people.)

My brother drives through the town she is in on his way home from work every day, so I asked him if he could pick it up for me on his way home but he said no. So I’m not really sure what to do. I’ve been struggling so hard since I was 13, which I had to raise myself from then till I was 18. I try so hard to keep my head floating above the water but every day it just goes deeper. None of my siblings will help me out, I don’t ask for money at all. I usually just find stuff I need on free sites on Facebook but I can’t ever get a ride to pick anything up because they all clearly make up excuses not to take me or grab it when they’re in that specific town. I’m slowly giving up. My dog deserves better, I love her so much but if I can’t even figure out how to get her dog food then I probably need to find her a home that can give her the life she deserves. I’m just worthless. I even give my brother most of the food stamps I get as a thank you for letting me stay with him so I barely even have food to feed myself. Me being born was a mistake (my mom was r4ped) so yeah life is really showing me just how much of a mistake I am. "

Does depression ever go away? I've had periods of time where things feel okay, and I feel like I've reached the surface of the water and I know where things are and what to do. And it's been nearly a year since I last engaged in self-harm. And I do not feel suicidal anymore, because I have things I want to do and people I want to see. But ever so often these depressing feelings or whatever just come back. This empty sort of feeling in my chest and the feeling that I need to cry- but I'm unable to. The hole in my chest is always there. Taking the path of just giving up on life and rotting away until the end of my life is always somewhere in there. I do not want to be alone with my thoughts, yet socializing is so frustrating and consumes all of my energy.

I've lost track of time. Or rather, I lost it a long time ago. The days just merge together. I can't put my finger on when things happened and I keep forgetting everything that happens. I turn 18 later this year which makes me a legal adult. The depressive episodes have been on and off since I was in elementary. Still, it feels like a couple of years ago.

 There's this feeling I'm never really present, as well. My physical body is there, but I still don't feel like I'm really *there*..? Like I'm just watching stuff happen. And responding on autopilot. Is it even me controlling my own body?

Yet there's still some kind of comfort to this loneliness, this emptiness- where I'm isolated from everyone else. On days where I feel better, I don't know who I am. I don't know who I am without my sadness. I can't identify myself and who I am as a person. What do I bring to people who know me? Who am I in their life? My mind is a mess... I feel like I've lost myself."

Hi peeps, I have been suffering from depression for the past 5 years. 

My symptoms include 

1) Feeling of no motivation
2) Difficulty in concentration
3) Anger issues (biting my fingers to a point, it bleeds, Throwing things, breaking my mobile, screaming, self harm etc) 
4) Tobacco addiction, couldn't stop (Whenever I try to quit something happens and go back to smoke) 
5) masturbation whenever stressed. 
6) Difficulty in falling asleep

I have tried 2 psychatrists and 3 psychologists. Nothing seems to be working. I didn't go to the last psychologists since they were asking 25,000 rupees for 12 sessions which I found it to be expensive. 

I have tried to workout, by work is kinda hectic and I am unable to wake up early because I sleep late and this has become a cycle. I tried to bulk because of my skinny structure but it seems after trying to gain some muscle, I have got cholestrol and prediabetes. This really demotivated me to eat anything. Plus, whenever I am stressed at work I just don't eat at all. I completely skip my breakfast/lunch many days. 

Coming to work 

I am one of the worst performer. In my last company, I was removed from my project because of my bad performance. However I managed to secure a job in another company but I feel like I am repeating the same mistake again. I am a developer with literally no skills cheating my manager as well as myself. Whenever I become stressed because of work, I turn off all the notifications and don't respond till evening. It seems some people have already started pointing out. I am 2018 graduate with 2.5 years gap. 3 years of total experience but still fail to understand many things in programming. Whereas graduates from 2021,22 are performing way better than me both in my current as well as previous organization. Because of my demotivation, I am putting way less efforts and gets dejected when they perform better/do the given tasks. 

Tablets tried : 

Lithium, Nexito 5, Olazapine, Newcita plus etc 

I don't know where to proceed, tried posting in many subs but it gets removed. Now my suicidal thoughts have become so high. 

Hobbies : I don't have any. My parents never encouraged to take up sports or dance/singing. I grew up as an introvert. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I am just bad at everything. Zero in academics because too many arrears, zero in work because of myself, zero in extra curricular activities partly because of myself.

I hate myself so much that I sometimes physically torture myself like banging my head on a wall , cutting myself, etc. I also have a huge insecurity about my dick size. I'm about 5 inches and I know it's the average size but I still fucking hate it. It's not that the rest of the world sees me like this...I have never gotten a single comment about my looks , the only thing someone ever said is that I'm overweight ( which I was but I look like a skeleton now ). I'm also kinda emotionally numb.. I've never ever loved a girl in my life , not even a crush on someone. Not just that , when people close to me die the best I feel is a little shocked but after like a few minutes I'm back to normal. I almost never cry , I can't remember the last time I cried, it has been years. I've had suicidal thoughts for years now..this whole thing started when I was 15..and it seems to have gotten worse every year. Why am I like this? "

In December, specifically around the period of the 28th to the 30th, I came down with the worst headache of my life. Both sides, about the eyes, temples, scalp running back. At the sometime, I started experiencing Depersonalization/Derealization like symptoms. In the past months, I had been in and out of the ER, Neuro ect. I've had CT scans, and MRI and didn't get any answer. My scans were just unremarkable. We think i somehow injured myself in the gym but we dont know anything for sure. The truth is my mind is stuck in existential thought mode and I'm truly falling apart. It feels like apart of me just died when this started. I am so sad, all the time. I feel like I don't have a future because I am in so much pain.  The headache has gotten better but psychologically I feel like ive been losing my shit for months and I just want it to stop. I want my life back, I just want to be able to smile, laugh and not feel this way. I don't know when or if I will ever feel like myself again. Its just so hard, and I'm tired of constantly being in this existential thought mode. I feel like ive tapped into something that nobody else can see, when i knows its not really the case. I'm tired of looking down at my arms, and forgetting im real. Im tired of not being able to sleep and pondering why i was put on this planet twenty four seven. I hate seeing the look of my loved ones faces when i wake up in the same funk every morning. I'm tired of feeling like im drowning. Before this started, I was in the best shape, mentally and physically. I had no mental problems, no serious anxiety and it just hit me. Its been months and I just want to like myself. On top of everything, I tried to distract myself and fill the void forming within me and put myself out there a girl at my college. I was just being lead on, as she agreed to go out and was constantly flirting, when in reality had a boyfriend and was just trolling me the entire time. At this point, I don't have a job, only a few friends. I dont even feel like picking up my guitar and playing. Im just so broken, and i feel so alone. I've never had any issues like this until the past months. My mind was always a safe spot for me, even if there was something physically going on with me. But this is just torture.

1bl537i,Respected-Mad-Man,1,0.0,1711129026,depression,"AM I DEPRESSED???? I know that a subreddit cannot diagnose me but I’m more or less curious as to understanding what I’m feeling and if anyone can give me any experiential insight

Just to give a quick background, I am an M21 who is in the entertainment industry (this will be relevant later) and for about the past month or so I have been waking up and almost instantly feeling this sense of disturbance or anger coming from what feels like outta nowhere

And as I’ll progress throughout my typical day, this anger or frustration will continue to show itself more. I’ll be frustrated about having to talk to intolerant friends and family members. I’ll be frustrated about feeling like people disagree with me all the time on just about everything. I’ll be frustrated about people never understanding what I’m talking about and having to constantly explain what I said no matter what it is. I’ll be frustrated having to interact with obnoxious fans on an almost daily basis as a manager. I’ll be frustrated about not having anyone to confide in or have some form of intellectually stimulating conversation with. And I’ll be frustrated about having to do “normal” sociable things when I don’t find them enjoyable or important.

I’ve been managing to contain and suppress these frustrations but just as recently as yesterday I’ve been having out-of-character outbursts/conflicts with others due to my own thoughts, feelings, and opinions on important or unimportant matters.

And now I’m at the point where I don’t even wanna discuss any of my ideas with anyone because I feel as though it’s a trivial pursuit if I’m just going to constantly be disagreed with and shut down. I don’t need validation or confirmation on my opinions, so there’s no point in even bringing them up. I’m more at peace with what I know personally vs what others think of me. The main issue is that I feel like I HAVE to engage in these types of conversations just to maintain my social rapport and keep my relationship with business partners afloat

I can understand that talking about how “nobody understands me…” or “everybody disagrees with my opinions….” can come off as corny or even pretentious, I am aware of that and can understand if anybody feels that way from reading this. But the bottom line is that I just wanna understand what my current issue is.

I feel way more frustrated than I do sad, but I do feel a sense of hopelessness in the form of “there’s no point of even talking” which is where my confusion on what I’m feeling is coming from. If anyone has any ideas on what this could be or any advice on how to deal with or manage it, a response would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I could never kill myself but I want to die every waking moment.

My ""friends"" mock me and say it's not a real thing. My parents mock me and say I just lazy and everything will become better once I get married.

My life WON'T improve.

A lot of people have no food or live on the streets or overall they live in worst conditions than me, so I should be grateful. What annoys the hell out of me is everything else beyond that depression. EVERYTHING in my life is a fucking mess and I have zero control over it. I live in a god-awful shithole of a country with no money and no means to escape. My health is trash and my attempts to fix it are laughable. The only person who actually tried to help me- I pushed them away, because I don't want them to suffer alongside. I don't think I was wrong but I miss having care and support. My cats are sick and I am so, so tired of being stressed, scared and feeling helpless. I wanted to become an artist, but, hah, of course NO ONE CARES. Sure, I don't draw for ""likes"" and ""views"", I love drawing for the sake of it, loved it since I was a little kid, but if no one sees it? No one interacts with it? What's the point? I can just draw it and never show to anyone. Here goes my dream of earning a living by doing what I love, lmao, guess I'll try in the next life! No, seriously, I know I am not some hot 100k followers artist but I never earned a single dollar with my art.

Every day it's something new. Every fucking day. I wake up and wonder ""hm what's that gonna be?"". You never know!

One day I got attacked in the shop, just minding my own bussiness. Another day I got attacked when I was throwing away garbage. I can never relax, I can barely sleep, my neighbours annoy the hell out of me with their noise. And somehow every time everyone around me twist like I AM the bad guy. ""You can't fight back!"" ""You can't criticize others!!"" ""Just shut up and struggle"". And sometimes I think, what even the point of my attempts? Every time I try to fix something or improve quality of my life, I fail miserably. I feel like ""Truman Show"" character, and audience watches me struggle and laughs at me while eating Cheetos. Hope you are having a great time, don't think this show gets renewed.

Sometimes I think how much better my life would have been if I was born in a different country. Maybe I would have met different people. Good people who were kind to me and didn't make me hate humanity as a whole. What if my parents weren't absolute sociopaths that ruined mental health. Huh.

at least i can say ""i'm working on that in therapy"" or ""i'm taking medications for all of that"" so then they'll think i might be on some kind of upward trajectory, but i ultimately feel like i'm not doing any of this shit for myself. sure, it'd be nice to not want to die or to not rot in bed, but i don't want life in the first place. i hate that the only times i feel somewhat okay are when people are in my life and giving me attention, but i don't want that fucking negative attention. i don't want people talking down to me, trying to give me advice, or giving me pity instead of getting closer.

i'm terrified of being alone and isolated, but i don't know if i can ever get closer to people especially because i have so much fear and hopelessness around it, and then of course there's this whole issue of pity and detachment by other people.

I am (18M) youngest of three (24F) (26F), we all came from a pretty abusive household with a psychopath for a mother and a super strict protective father, we managed to all move out and go to another country, we all had very obvious unhealed traumas from our parents (i was the only person in the house who cleans, works and cooks whilst also studying and using my own freetime for hobbies and friends), and instead of ever receiving any sort of appreciation or even just a small thanks, id get belittled or ridiculed or yelled at for when i did not have enough energy to clean or cook, but i was completely numb to it as thats how they have been my whole life.

&#x200B;

Since now we're in a new country, I decided its time for a new chapter and start in my life, i decided to go to therapy to deal with my own traumas/problems as well as working out 6 times a week, few months later things are starting to look up, starting to make a lot of friends and having fun, eventually my friend introduces me to this (19F) girl, whom i hit it off with instantly, we talked alot and everything felt great, she invites me to her post exam party (party ended at 7 pm) and i ended up staying with her alone until 1 am, eventually we kept getting closer and closer, and opening up more and more, we both provided an immense amount of comfort and understanding for one another, we fell in love after 3 months of knowing each other, i would spend all my time with her to escape the shenanigans at home, after a few weeks of us together i decide to buy her a gift to show my gratitude for her love and affection, a bunch of items for around 80$, she hugs me and later on starts crying and tells me she loves me so much but she feels like she hasn't healed from her last relationship (4 months prior to meeting me with a very fucking horrible avoidant guy) and that i deserve better and she wants to be at her 100% with me, i tell her that healing isn't a linear process and that she doesn't have to go through this alone and she continues to disagree, breaks up with me, ""remain as friends"".

Suddenly she acts distanced and passive aggressive for 2 whole months, one day i couldn't excuse being disrespected for the compromise of love anymore and i asked her to see me so we can talk about it and we did, she ends up telling me that she doesn't see me as anything but a friend and she can't let me get any closer to her than ""this"" because i will hurt myself, i lose my shit because i was lead on and hurt, cut off all contact (01/29/2024).

Now back home, everything feels 15x worse, the complete and utter silence of my phone is haunting, i don't have any friends because all of my friends were in her friend group, don't have university until august,  don't talk to anyone at gym because i hate being bothered in the gym myself, sex drive and lovesickness at an all time high, can't tone out and be numb to the bullshit of my siblings because she pulled me out of that world and truly showed me what it meant like to be loved, nothing i can do about it, everyday feels harder than the last to wake up, go out once a week to buy groceries because we live in a small town and i end up seeing her almost everytime i go out with the rest of my friends. its genuinely so fucking dreadful, i'm willing to take any advice on what can i do. 

TL;DR Horrid family, love of my life pulls me out of that world, makes me truly experience life and its pleasures, breaks up with me, can't move on or do anything, even the idea of going to therapy to move on, reminds me of her so thats counterproductive. wrote 3 different itterations of suicide notes last week, every single day gets fucking harder, any help is great."

I (42M) have had depression and anxiety my entire life.  As a kid, we didn't know what it was (especially in the black community).  I was just seen as ""something is wrong with me"".  I've always been introverted and sensitive.  With that, I have never had a positive view of myself, and low self-esteem was/is normal for me.  

Fast forward to today.  Divorced, 3 kids (13M, 10M, 3F), and just depressed as hell.  My 3yo was a happy surprise, and she keeps me on my toes.  She and her mom live with me, but the relationship with her mom is pretty much just roommates and co-parenting.  

On the outside, it looks like I don't have a reason to complain.  When I look at it, I really don't have a reason to complain, but my brain chemistry just won't allow me to be happy.  I've been on meds for years, did TMS Therapy, and that worked to help me not have the doom feeling all the time.  That also reduced my suicide ideation a ton.  What they, or therapy, haven't fix is that I don't care about myself, and I don't even know how.

There's been a series of events, especially in the last 6 months, that when all added together just broke me.  Most of it happening around me, and to the people I love.  It has me to the point where I don't have the capacity to pursue any romantic relationship ever again.  Once my daughter gets out of daycare, her mom will be able to afford to live on her own, then we can share custody.  I will miss not having my daughter with me everyday, but her mother deserves WAY better than what I'm not giving her.  I can't love her the way she deserves to be love, or anyone else ever again for that matter.  I just want to be single for the rest of my life.  I could care less about intimacy because I can take care of myself without the need to have performance anxiety, sweat because I'm fat, blah blah blah.

I don't know how to ""love me"" and don't think I want to.  I just want to keep myself alive and employed to take care of my kids.  I don't want to traumatize them by taking my life, that part scares the shit out of me and I love them too much.  I can play the long game of appearing like I'm okay for them, my job, family and friends.  I have to do that because I refuse, REFUSE to burden anyone with my feelings about me.  I've faked it for 42 years, and just have to fake it until my daughter is an adult, and then I can really be done.

I'm just gonna stop here because this could be a book lol.  I kind of just wanted an outlet because people in my life will never understand."

I'm 36, divorced with two kids, 13 and 11...also recently out of an engagement(although we are still good friends).

I feel like there's so much weighing on me, that I don't know where to start.

After splitting with my ex-fiancée and now living alone with absurd rent and all other usual bills, I am struggling to make ends meet. My ex-wife has moved my kids 3 hours away, and with child support being one of my usual expenses, I can barely afford to visit them. She has recently talked about wanting to move them from PA to Illinois for the sake of her family, to which I said absolutely not. Well, it seems that I am the bad guy now, since all of the sudden my kids have this urge to want to move there. They've never mentioned it once before, and now they won't even talk to me...no returning my calls or replying to my texts.

I live alone, and everyday after work I find myself being a hermit, since I can't afford to go out. I don't have a single friend who I can call to grab a drink with, so I often drink alone at home. I do not drink during the week, and always have a glimmer of hope of doing something fun on the weekend...to no avail. Everyday now when I get home from work, I sit in silence and wonder why...why the fuck is this all happening. I lost my kids in a sense, I lost my fiancée, I went from doing real estate with her full-time(she owns the real estate office we are with), to thankfully securing a full-time job with decent pay and good hours.  With the loss of her and I's relationship, came the lost of all the friends we would hang out with. Her friends had their boyfriends/husbands that I would hangout with, and I haven't heard a word from anyone since the split.

My physical health isn't 100% which takes a toll on me. I have arthritis in both knees, which makes doing a lot of what I love, very hard to do. I am receiving disability from the VA for this, since it first started up as an issue when I was active duty. Running, hiking, lifting weights, calisthenics...all things I would love to do, I almost can't. I am 6'2"" and about 280lbs, and I would love to get down to about 230, but with a thyroid issue and limited capabilities due to my knees, it seems I can only maintain a healthy diet and do mostly upper body, which can only do so much.

As I'm typing this, it doesn't seem to be the biggest issues, but I feel defeated and so alone in life, and ponder daily if it's worth it. My kids are the only reason I am here, but as of late, I begin to even wonder how affected they would be if I wasn't here.

I'm crossing my fingers that things can improve, and I am doing my best to put effort into making things improve...but that all still doesn't help me not feel alone.

I realize this may have gone off course, and I am not the best at explaining how I am feeling, but I did feel the need to at least get it off my chest."

I am medicated for depression and anxiety. I go on walks. I go to gym. I play videogames. I draw. I eat healthy. I eat tasty. I have a healthy sleep schedule. I go out. None of that works anymore. I feel sick and I feel tired. I feel scared and alone. I don't know what to do and it's hard to want to do anything anymore.

Every day, every hour, CONSTANTLY, I wish for death. I don't want to do it to myself, I just want it to happen to me. A freak accident. An unavoidable event. Some incurable disease. I am so tired of feeling like this.

I desperately want to cry. I want to show my emotions. I used to be so in touch with my emotions - I could speak about things, I could cry about things... Now, nothing. I try to cry, nothing. A few tears at best. Not enough to call it ""crying"", just enough to call ""teary-eyed"". 

It's taking a toll on my relationship with my girlfriend.

1bl1n5n,Ok_Procedure3055,1,0.0,1711120452,depression,"I feel like there’s more and I’m alone  I’m not sure how to start this. I think I was drawn to this place because of the comfortable anonymity. So I think I can say it. I’m a writer- I write poems and I have written stories in the past. I’ve been inclined to it above everything else and I still feel like it’s my most primitive and natural instinct to write. I keep diaries. I write everything in them. So naturally, if anyone read them…well…

I’m incessantly looking for something more. I have glimmers of fleeting moments etched into my mind and I have cultivated poems from them. I feel like I belong in these moments. I feel at home when I listen to songs and lyrics that evoke this emotion. I feel like I’m meant to live. Live like no one has ever live. I have this persistent and compelling desire to find out what this all means. To live all these moments and discover the unknown. To be bathed in thrill and to feel voraciously. I know this is all verbose and complicated- but I couldn’t possibly express the desperation and urgency I feel without…this. And I’m alone. I don’t expect others to absorb what I say and just blurt out sweet nothings. I don’t expect to be understood. I wish I was acknowledged and admired and listened to. But there’s no such person. I have so much hope that I’m yet to know all the people I will love- inspired by a post I saw on Pinterest “You haven’t met all the people you will love”. There’s something so enigmatic about it- yet so, so relieving. 

But these are thoughts. When it boils down to what is real- I’m barely in it. My parents expect things from me. Society has drawn out rigid paths for compliance. I have a disdain for people who think that a person is simply a perception of them. And I feel that we are reduced to our perceptions all the time. You might be thinking that I posted under the wrong thread, this all makes more sense philosophically. But the truth is that I’m in so much pain- and it’s because of all this that I’m suffering. I feel tormented when no one did anything in particular to hurt me. I feel pressured to conform and be reduced to my “ideal” and “rational” self. I’m 16. I don’t know anything about college or the world. I feel that I’m being pigeon-holed into a path that promises success- but at what cost? Writing an essay to a university, how much of myself can I release? I certainly cannot attach my Reddit profile because then they would read this and find out who I actually am. So I’m living a superficial lie. And then I realise that we’re all living a superficial lie. I’ve had countless revelations like these over a period of time and I believe they have all collated to create my depression. There’s so much left unspoken. I haven’t even begun to express how shattered I feel every single day. How desperate and devoid I am of love. But if no one knows, at least you do now. I’ll surely write more, and i’ll certainly vent here.

--/

Seven months ago, I tried to kill myself.

In the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.

I then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.

Now, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.

And suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.

Emotionally, there's multiple issues:

1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.

2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.

3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.

4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.

So, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.

I know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself? How do I stop seeing myself as being a bad person for what I've done?"

1bkzgen,BossWriter77,1,0.0,1711114710,depression,"Broken Self What do you do when no one answers when you call? I (46F) have never really had a home or friends. No one to really care about me. As a baby, I was born slightly deformed. I didn't know I was until I was about 8yrs I guess. Maybe 13yrs, that was the age my mother told me and I have never looked in the mirror the same way since. By the time I was 9 months old, (I have a photo of me at that age) you can't tell that my face was crooked. I can though. I almost died twice as a baby. My father was cleaning his guns and my mother had laid me on the floor next to him. The gun fired missing me by about a foot from what my mother told me. The first time it was a break-over shotgun so I don't understand how he couldn't have known it was loaded. I think they were both drunk. I almost died as a toddler. My mother left me on the shore of a lake, I was about 3yrs, and she swam away from me. I had tried to reach her and almost drowned because no one was watching me. At about 7yrs, my father almost drowned me. He had grabbed my ankles and dragged me underwater about three feet into deep water. My aunt and uncle that was there was laughing at me as I crawled out of the water coughing up water. I remember my father telling me I was fine and to just get up and go back to swimming. I never went back in the water while with any of them around. If I did, the water had to be clear and I always needed to know where they were to me. A few times they tried to get my cousins to drag me in the water. They all stopped when I held one of them under the water and blooded the nose of another. At age 7yrs my mother and father were divorced. My mother had abandoned us to our father. She always had an excuse as to why we couldn't visit. The courts had given her my younger brothers (conceived during a separation while drinking) and me and the oldest boy to our father. But she just left all of us with him. In many ways, he was the better parent. We were always broke and mostly homeless. I say mostly homeless because we would live with my grandparents and aunt and uncle (my dad's sister) Later I learned that when we weren't living with them, it was because my father was fighting with my aunt and uncle. usually over money.At around 10yrs, we were back with my mom. Living with her sister and son. Then we were at my grandmother's (her mom) until they would be fighting over money. At 11yrs we finally had a home but our mother was once again tired of being a parent. She was able to send my brothers to live with our father again, but I refused to go and my step-mother told my father that she didn't want me with them. For years it went like this. my mother trying to trick me into living with my father and my stepmother fighting to keep me out. Whenever I was forced to live with them, she would move out. I was made to know that her leaving was my fault. At 13 or 14yrs, I had enough of that. Three knock down drag out fights finished that living situation. Back at my mother's but I was never home. I would go to school just to eat. I would go to friends' homes just to feel wanted but learned I wasn't by their parents. It would go on like that until I was 18yrs.That's when I would just be dating someone just to learn he didn't want me either. At 21, I married a man who told me he only married me because I looked like his true love (mother of his twins conceived after we married) At 18yrs, I had planned to end myself at 21, but I was pregnant. I had hoped my marriage would get better because we were having a son. Instead, he kicked us out when my son was 2 months and moved her in. We were homeless and so that I could work, I had to force my mother to watch her grandson. She only would if the weird neighbor wouldn't. My ex-husband refused to pay support and I couldn't get paid enough so I couldn't afford childcare. I was able to keep us in a home but barely kept the lights on. I spend years alone with my son. Every ""man"" I was interested in was not interested in me beyond a one-night stand. When my son was 7yrs, I met someone. I was so lonely, I didn't care about his past. But his past caused me to spiral. Lost our home. Lost my friends. So after finally giving him up, I moved us to my mother's to start over. Then I lost my son. He went into CPS and I was forced to spend so much time fighting for him with no help. No support. Having to beg ""family"" to at the very least take him in. I am alone living in the Salvation Army shelter. I met someone. He was alone too. I tried again. Had a daughter, while still fighting for my son. CPS kept telling him I was on drugs and didn't want to visit him. CPS would tell me that he didn't want to see me. Once I called the state capital CPS home of and forced a review of my case, my son was returned to me. But the child I got back wasn't my son. I got a young man that thought it was ok to steal from me. The TPS refused to educate him, so I had to send him to my brother's so he could go to school. Instead, he quit and started doing drugs. For 8 years, I have supported him, supported his then-girlfriend. Helped them get jobs and gave them a home. All that was asked of them was to watch his sister and clean up after themselves. My home turned into a dumpster and I had to force them out. She committed su\*\*ide  and my son was there when it happened. So I was back to supporting him. He would put me down. Make sure I knew I was worthless as a mother and blame me for HIS depression. Here it is 2024, my daughter will soon be 8yrs and my son is 24 and I am so depressed, so tired, so alone that I no longer want to wake up in the morning. I don't want my daughter to be the one that finds me. I don't want to leave her behind to a world she will never know love in. So I sit here crying. I woke up again and now I got to try and find some strength to care for her. I want to scream. I want to through things. I want my sadness to just die. just a few days ago I had asked the Goddess to bring into my life someone to help me. To be my support. Now, I am facing homelessness again. I am facing being unemployed again. I am facing my daughter going to CPS again. I have learned this lesson. I don't want to repeat this lesson again. I have failed at life. Not the lessons learned. I don't know what to do. I just don't wish to wake up in the morning again. I can't off myself because I don't want it to be my daughter to find me. I want to disappear alone but I can't leave her behind. I am too tired to go, but I am too sad to stay."

A few days ago, I was at my cousins and decided to weigh myself to see how much weight I've lost... I've lost 30lbs in the last 3 months. It didn't start as a complete aversion to food, just not having an appetite. My moods tanked significantly in the last couple of weeks, and now I feel like I don't deserve to eat. I went to the ER after weighing myself to make sure there wasn't an underlying medical cause, but now that's all been ruled out, I've realized that I'm doing this to myself. My appetites gotten even worse, and I haven't eaten in 2 days, 3 if you don't count half a donut and a mandarin orange as food.

I worry I dont have enough friends, I feel jealous of people who go out every week and always seem to have someone to hang out with.  I constantly feel like i dont have enough friends and my relationships arent deep enough.

1bkvyju,Judgemental_Joker,1,0.0,1711103020,depression,"I'm sorry it is a long post, but I have to let it all out I have been in therapy and medications for 6 years now. It all started when I left a confusingly toxic home to become a writer. Before that I lived my whole life trying to get approval from my parents. Everything I did was just to make them happy, until I finally gave in and could gather enough courage leave home and still living, trying to get them to say that they are proud of me.

I left home to become a writer, thought of getting a job on the side to pay my bills as I didn't have any support from family. After years of trying, I do get appreciation wherever I go, but earning hardly anything from it. And the job which was supposed to be a backup for my writing career, has become the main thing and writing is not even backup now.

In 26 years of my life, I have got abused physically by parents, raped on multiple occasions by a cousin, an uncle, got sexually abused by strangers on 2 different occasions. I started dating at the age of 15, coz I had to look for love outside, as I wasn't getting it at home. I gave love a chance, 5 times in my whole life. In first 2, I got cheated on, third one left coz her best friends thought I wasn't good for her, 4th one was all good at first but then things started getting very toxic. The person I was with, would lie and cheat, would call me randomly and say some cuss words and hang up, with me trying to figure out what just happened. Things went on to get so bad that just to get out of it, for the first time in my life, while being in a relationship, when someone who is not my girlfriend, tried to kiss me, I didn't stop her. When I realised what I just did, I couldn't live that. I would get the episodes of anxiety where I couldn't even breathe and would be rolling on the floor. I couldn't live with the disgust of what I had become.

I tried to kill myself on multiple occasions. I didn't want to just hurt myself, I wanted this life to end. But don't know what it is with me and death that no matter how much accurately I would plan it, I won't die, somehow. I don't see any hope, any point of living this life anymore.

With the frustration in my last job, I even had to quit it.

Now with hardly any money on me, any work on me, any family or friends or anyone by myside, I am sitting here in my apartment, with a half burnt cigarette, teared up eyes, almost choking, trying to figure out how to get another work and pay my rent next month, and for my therapy and for my medications.

Funny thing is, the last piece of work I have written so far, was my suicide note.

I don't know what to do from here.

I’ve never been diagnosed, but I think I’ve been living with depression on and off for a long time now. This time though it’s been harder to push the bad thoughts away. 

Im single and close to 40 and this last half year has been one of the roughest and I’m struggling to find a light to  guide me.

- July, car broke down. Out of commission for two plus months. 
- August, put myself into financial hardship to keep job since they wouldn’t let me work remote or hybrid and they are a 45 minute drive away. Had to get a second vehicle I couldn’t afford. 
- September, company reorganization. I get switched to a whole new job, team, and building. I know no one and I’m not a social person. I struggle with the new position. 
- October, my mom dies. This one hurts a ton because she was always there for me and now I don’t have anyone I trust to talk to. 
- November, get fired. Got told that I was missing deadlines and job functions that I was never informed about. 
- December, get a new job, it doesn’t pay the bills. Start to get behind on everything. Can’t afford a Christmas for me and my kids that I have split custody of. 
- January, mine and my moms birthday month. I start struggling with my age and how unaccomplished and worthless I feel. 
- February, have several promising interviews for better jobs. Got rejected from the one I thought I did the best at and have been ghosted on the others. Feeling pretty worthless. 
- March, one kid gets admitted to a behavioral health center with suicidal thoughts that I was unaware of. CPS starts an investigation into me on alleged abuse of a different kid which is completely bogus. Get served to go to a custody hearing next week. I have no information about what’s going on. I’m also several months behind on mortgage and other bills. Oh, and I got fired this week again because I can’t concentrate on work. 

I’ve always kicked the bad thoughts away because I’ve never wanted to leave my kids. But now I might be losing them and I’m spiraling. They are the last things that have been keeping me grounded to this life. 

I’ve thought of whether I would give things away and to whom. I’ve thought about what notes and mementos I would leave behind. I’ve thought of how I would do it. I’m scared because anytime I’ve had those thoughts, I’ve dismissed them immediately. But now, there’s a maybe to them all. I pulled up the website on my phone to call the other day because the thoughts got intense on my drive home.

I have a sister who is 3-4 years younger than me. We used to be relatively close when we were younger. However, as time went by, I was a lot more focused on school and friends so we talked a lot less. When quarantine happened, I isolated myself and was just watching shows and studying on my own so I hardly even saw her or spoke with her and wherever we did it was always an argument. It's been 4 years now since we had an honest heart-to-heart. And in these 4 years, she has grown up to be someone I detested. She would swear at my mother and sometimes act physically with her, she would also swear at my stepdad when all they both did was concern themselves with her well-being, appearance, education, and relationship with god . She would speak to my mother with such attitude and sarcasm which would make me dislike her even more. She steals their money. She even ran away from home once, and my mother and uncle had to chase after her. My stepdad has an issue with his feet and is due to have surgery later this year, and my mother has extremely varicose veins. so you can imagine how distraught I was to find her laughing about their failed attempt at chasing after her. It reached a point where I thought I was at fault since I am the older sister, and maybe she was acting out because I don't talk to her anymore. So I said sorry for the way I've treated her. She said sorry too and we both cried. A day later, I talked to her about her actions and how disrespectful it is, but nothing changed. Funnily enough, she swears at my mother at some point in the day, every day, and still acts the same way with attitude religion, etc, even with me now she steals my clothes, not returning them, my makeup, my food, and lies about it and is also rude to me as well and shows no emotion when I speak to her kindly as though I am speaking to the dead. I want to cut her off completely now but want to make sure I'm justified in doing that. I want to also say my mom works hard 4 jobs every day my uncle doesnt work due to his leg and so it hurts to see my mom lose her money because of a thieving daughter."

I had an assignment due on Monday, an essay with 1500 words and I started it quite early and I should have finished on time, IF I had done it properly. But it is Friday now and I haven’t submitted it at all. I had already done 700 words on Monday so I only needed another 800 words but I cannot seem to write it at all. After Monday I haven’t started my essay at all. If I start writing again I get stuck within first few sentences and instead of continuing I do something else like watch tiktok or movies. Even now, I opened my laptop to do my assignment but I am writing this bs instead. 

This has happened before and I have not submitted my assignments at all and have failed and paid to study the same course again multiple times. I have gone through depression due to this but I still don’t seem to improve. 

I thought I didn’t deserve to live because of how I am messing my life and other peoples expectations. But I thought I don’t want to kms and wanted to continue living and try a bit harder than before. But this is not it. I am repeating the same pattern. And I am afraid I am going to get depressed again if this continues. And I might just end my life because I don’t want to repeat it over and over again. This is just affecting people near me. They can’t pay my fees forever and I can’t do it either. I am not a talented person to start a new career or something new. I am just wasting mine and everyone else’s time at this point.

I’m 22 and I’ve been depressed since about 12. I thought it was “just a phase “ like everyone kept telling me it was. And year after year I kept believing it. I always thought life would get better. And there are pockets of time where I feel like I’ve finally beaten depression and can move on. But I quickly find myself in the same vicious cycle of depression and disassociation. I had a drunken father for the early years of my life and both my parents would beat me for just being a kid. They have made a complete flip now but the damage they have caused lives with me forever. 

I’ve been in a lot of relationships over the years, many of them not lasting a couple months. Mainly because I would rather push people away than let them get close and hurt me and break me more than I already am. I eventually found someone who didn’t run or give up when I pushed her away. We have been married for a couple years and have a couple of kids. And I thought it would make me happy and change me. I have learned a lot and have shared a ton of unforgettable memories together with my family. But throughout our marriage the cycle persisted. I’m to the point where getting out of bed is so hard. Showering, eating, going out, it’s such a chore. And more days than not I feel numb, I don’t feel anything when looking at my wife’s and kids. I feel a shit ton of guilt because of it. 

I’ve gone to therapy earlier in life and they didn’t help. I’ve attempted to book appointments an always answer truthful on the mental health questionnaires when going to the clinic for check ups and stuff. But no one gets back to me, no one seems to give a fuck. I do things now to cope that I am not proud of. But yeah, I just wanted to rant.

Told my family I’m depressed and wake up feeling like I’ve run a marathon despite getting 10 hours of sleep. 

Them: Wow, that’s weird. I’m sure you’re overreacting. You should talk to a doctor about that. 

Told my family the doctor made worried faces and kept re-doing my vital checks. That I’ve fainted 6 times in 2 years without my body giving a warning. Told them about the time I almost died one time, woke up with my eyes bruised, nose bloody from my unconscious body smashing my face into the floor from spasms, gasping for breath. That I know somethings wrong, and I’m genuinely scared of being alone. 

Them: Wow that’s strange. You should see a doctor about that. It’s up to you to take the 2 hour trek into town though, good luck, try not to pass out on the way there I guess. Anyway I’m going to spend the next 15 minutes talking about my island vacation and act like you didn’t say anything. By the way feel free to reach out anytime I’m happy to help. 

Told my family I need help. That getting up, making food and drinking water is getting to be impossible some days. That I feel so empty, unmotivated and alone every day. Rent and food princes keep going up, and the realization I’ll never have a home or family of my own is affecting me. I want a future but don’t see one. That just talking with them helps. That I need guidance and advice, I can’t do this alone. That my therapist told me to talk to my family, because going back to a psych ward would make everything so much worse. I crave connection so bad I dream about it. That I do want help and to get better, but with every step in the right direction I make, I keep getting pushed back 3. I still want to keep trying, but am overwhelmed with memories, debt, and unending news about the world getting more impossible to live in. Climate change and pandemics currently affecting the reality I’m in, but I’m told talking about it will be weird, and break normalcy. 

Them: Wow, that’s a lot. You’re kind of bumming me out, and I don’t want to sit with an uncomfortable feeling long enough to even pretend faking empathy. That anything other than puppies and kittens, I don’t want to talk about. That my voice is going to remain cold and distracted through this conversation so you can tell I think you’re crazy. There’s nothing the doctors will find through the tests to explain your symptoms. There’s nothing wrong with your heart, you’re just overthinking. You don’t need a diagnosis, just need to try harder. You should talk to a therapist about this. Even though you can’t afford one anymore after your job laid you off. Which was all your fault by the way. Sucks for you I guess. Anyway have I told you about this party I went to- 

Told my family I got 3 letters from the hospital booking me for cardiology appointments. I still don’t know what’s wrong with my body. I feel like my past is catching up to me. I’ve taken responsibility on my choices and actions, know where I messed up, and where I just needed more support. I’ve struggled with procrastination and anxiety which affected my work and studies. I wasn’t able to finish post-secondary school, and got fired. I’m trying to change, and want to make better choices. But the days keep slipping by faster than I can keep up. I want to grow and be gentler, but keep getting panic attacks that seems to leech hours from the day. I keep falling asleep randomly and stay asleep for too long. That even when I’m awake, everything feels so dark and heavy. Like I’m constantly pulling 10,000 pounds on my back and can’t drop it. That even though I’m sober, I feel like I’m walking in a dream, everything’s fuzzy and snapping out of it takes up all the little energy I do have. I keep getting angry at myself for not having enough energy, too much anxiety. How it feels like my mind is torturing my body. How every therapy technique I’ve been given doesn’t stop it. I’ve been to over 3 dozen councillors, therapists and psychologists, majority telling me I’m beyond what they are capable of treating. I’ve listened to countless podcasts and books about tips and tricks, grounding techniques and naming every emotion I feel. Nothing helps. That my mind consumes me with extreme guilt and rage over small accidents like dropping a glass. I keep screaming at myself alone in my apartment because I’m so frustrated I can’t bring myself to get up. That I know I’m self-destructing, but don’t know how to stop spiralling. That I don’t want to burden them with my mind, but if they would talk to me like a human, maybe I’ll start feeling like one. If they could just call me every once in a while, let me know I’m not as alone as I know I am. That maybe if they see physical reasons I’m suffering, instead of mental, they’ll possibly take me seriously. If they saw a broken heart instead of a broken mind, they might care. To listen to what I’m saying instead of making assumptions or opinions. I’m not blaming them or even myself anymore for the past, I just want to get better and live. That I’m being honest, because that’s what they said I should do. But when I’m honest about being suicidal, they look at me like I’m a monster. Begging them to just tell me to keep trying. 

Them: This is your fault, and because of only your choices. Why are you telling me about your medical issues. You’re being ungrateful for the past help we’ve given. There is something wrong with you, but it’s your soul and sins. I’m going forget the actions of the people from this family who gave you panic attacks by chasing you through the house screaming at you to be normal after you wore blue lipstick to school once. That we said we didn’t believe you. That we said being gay isn’t something this family agrees with. That you should forgive the beatings your father gave you. You should ignore him saying in front of your sister, that he doesn’t love you, and no one likes you. That your sister agreed. It was your fault CPS made him feel temporary shame, but then believed him when he said he never hurt you. Ignore the trauma your mothers violent death at her own hands gave you. That even though you remember at 10 years old telling her to stop being distracted driving, she kept doing it. Why can’t you get your drivers license. Why can’t you get a job. Why can’t you just eat. Why can’t you just be normal and just stop thinking. You’re obviously not trying hard enough. Now, if you’re done complaining, I’m not going to talk to you for the next 6 months, and “pray” you’ll find the light. 

Me: I’m sorry for bothering you "

1bku13l,Gold-Order-8004,4,0.0,1711094662,depression,"How depression and anxiety made me implode both mentally and physically  I’ve been struggling with moderate depression and anxiety throughout my entire life and pretty much learned how to live with it. Ironically living with these conditions wasn’t  the part I became the most skilled at. Hiding how I was actually feeling every day was my super power.

 Let’s face it no one wants to be around a person that is constantly in a bad headspace and doesn’t want to leave the house due to overwhelming anxiety. The result was as you’d expect I was the kid that always had a smile on his face and pretended like  I wasn’t suffering of crippling anxiety and depression just so I could fit in. 

This strategy worked pretty good and even though I was suffering every day I managed to sustain a “normal life”.  At some point you no longer feel like you’re suffering because you’re kind of normalizing the emotional and physical pain accompanied by these mental health conditions. But obviously I reached my limit at some point. I quite literally imploded both mentally and physically. 

It started with slightly heightened anxiety which then got worse and worse until I was so anxious I couldn’t get out of bed because I would literally pass out.  My resting heart rate would average around 120 bpm, and I experienced shortness of breath all day. Couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t concentrate. 

Then I also unlocked a new range of symptoms. Derealisation and  depersonalisation scared the living shit out of me. It got so bad that at some point it felt like I woke up in a complete nightmare. About 90% of my memories were gone and I had this weird out of body feeling 24/7. 

I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation before but due to the exacerbated anxiety and depression this time the emotional and physical pain became so unbearable that I started planning to end my life. 

Luckily my attempt was pretty half assed mainly because I didn’t had the mental energy to think it through properly. 

I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. The psychiatrist put me on both sertraline (SSRI) and bupropion (SNDRI) and I started seeing a therapist. 

Moral of the story: don’t think you can overcome these cruel mental health conditions by yourself. I kept al my problems to myself because I was ashamed of them. 

I literally had so many reasons not to feel the way I felt. I have a loving family that support me in any way possible, have lovely friends that make me feel comfortable with being myself, never ever struggled financially, although I wouldn’t describe myself as good looking I have been told that I have decent looks, and psychological  tests revealed that my IQ scores around 125. I bet some people would pay a lot of money to posses al these things but I felt insanely numb about them which caused a ton of guilt and low self esteem 

Later on my psychiatrist explained that depression often isn’t caused by your life conditions but rather influenced by your perspective on these conditions. 

Having depression or anxiety is NOT your fault.  Yes some lucky people in this world may barely or never struggle with them whilst you can’t live a normal life. 

Life is not fair. I know that sounds extremely pessimistic but once you start accepting  it you find yourself comparing your life to other people’s lives less often. 

For those of you reading this who are also thinking about ending their lives. Please hear me out. 

I won’t give you some glamourised speech about why life is worth living. Because if you’re actively thinking about suicide you’re going through pain so extreme that I’ll probably never ever find the words to comprehend your suffering. 

That said only the fact that you’re reading these words and are still breathing proves incomprehensible courage and mental strength. 

Even though suicide crossed your mind numerous times you’re still here. I can imagine you might not believe this but the fact you’re still here is because there is still something in you that wants to live. 

Every time suicide crosses your mind and you dismiss the thought is proof that deep inside you there is something that wants to live and more importantly believes there is still hope. 

Sending lots of love and hugs to all of you suffering ❤️

It's so hard to gather myself and dedicate to any kind of long-term tasks and work.  
I'm turning 27 in 5 days on the 27th. It should feel like a turning point now but I've been in a depressive rut for 7+ years having accomplished nothing with my life. I never finished college because I found great difficulty in concentrating on long-term tasks and I always had a cruel inner voice which prevented me from working hard.  
I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder at a psych clinic in late 2017 after my first severe mental breakdown at home. Got prescribed with Brintellix and afterwards Quetiapine for more than a year and was completely meds-free by January 2019.  
Mostly drifted by at life for all the years since then...  
I still live with my parents in a remote rural area where public transport is infrequent and I don't have a driver's license to travel around. I don't have a job or the financial means to leave so I can be in a stimulating environment like art studios, dance clubs, or museums. Sometimes, I play the lottery just for the blind hope of getting money to fly away.  
I just spend my days on the internet consuming philosophy content or playing video games and watching porn. I wish this cycle could just end. I want to make more art and live out there as a real human bean (and a real hero). Fuck being poor if I have to.   
On the plus side, I've been taking psilocybin mushrooms by micro dosing and occasional heroic doses since mid 2022.  I'm in a good episode right now, I believe, because of the shrooms.   
I just don't know how to start anew and take more charge of my own life because I've been powerless and helpless for so long.

1bkttc9,lindsayleonaa,9,10.0,1711093672,depression,"Is it too late to have healthy teeth? Hi there,

I'm a 21-year-old woman, and I've been dealing with depression for most of my life. Because of this, I haven't been taking care of myself well, especially when it comes to my physical health, like dental care.

Growing up, I wasn't great at brushing my teeth and flossing regularly. Even though I knew it was important, I often skipped it, especially when I became more independent. It's not that I didn't know how to do it or wasn’t taught how; it's just that the feeling and sensation of brushing my teeth felt uncomfortable, so I avoided it when I could which became more and more frequent as i aged. 

When I got braces at 12, things got worse. Some parts of my teeth were covered, and I couldn't clean them properly even when i did feel up to brushing. I ended up with cavities under my braces, so they had to take them off way too early, and I lost track of my retainer, so my teeth shifted back after the braces were removed. I feel terrible because my parents spent a lot of money on my braces, and I didn't take care of my teeth properly. I have a stage 3 overbite which has always caused me extreme issues in my self esteem and having a habit where i put things in front of my mouth when i’m talking, without even noticing i’m doing so. I’d have to spend another 5 grand on braces to get rid of the overbite. 

Now, my teeth are yellow, I have several cavities, and two of my teeth are broken, falling apart into pieces. I'm scared to go to the dentist because I'm ashamed of letting it get this bad. I'm worried that even if I go and get the cavities fixed, my teeth will still look disgusting and I'll have spent hundreds on fillings to still have extreme self esteem issues. 

I feel like I've ruined my teeth in the first 20 years of my life, and I'm angry at myself for it. This is a big factor in my depression as ironic as it sounds. I don’t wanna go out and have fun because i’ll laugh and smile and then it’s just all on display. 
I'm afraid I'll never have nice teeth without spending thousands on procedures like veneers or expensive whitening treatments, and I'll always have gaps in my teeth from breaks and them being shaven down due to cavities

Am I stuck with these unhealthy, discolored, and gapped teeth forever?"

i used to say that frustration with myself “wasn’t me“ and I’d almost try to de associate it with myself, i thought of it like a demon in my head, but within the last year I started viewing it as just me having frustration and annoyances with myself, I also stopped letting the negativity engulf me, as I had a bad habit of becoming fully self critical when I got even a little frustrated, partly because it garnered me sympathy at a time I wasn’t capable of gaining it in other ways. I’m sorry for my ramblings but I really only started to notice these changes as of late. I think this coupled with getting off meds that might have been inconsistent (liquid Zoloft mixed in with orange juice to now pill form) but I don’t know what caused a shift. I just stopped trying to make excuses for it and actually tried to own up to it and help myself (not that I hadn’t before, I was just very gloomy and tense, causing me to be disappointed in everything and making me miserable) I also realized I was bisexual after trying to repress same sex attraction.

So I’m pretty against medication, I have anxiety around side effects and not feeling natural and comfortable in my body (I don’t drink or even take pain killers or anything because I don’t like not having control over my mind/body). I’ve recently been diagnosed with a brain condition and depression. My brain meds have been fucking amazing and I’m a bit more open to the idea of trying out medications in general now. 

The only other medication I’ve ever taken really was Lexapro a few years back, the smallest dose (due to my anxiety) and it made no effect whatsoever, positive or negative, couldn’t even tell I was taking it. 

My doctor is super supportive of my look and anxiety around medications and is happy for me to get a gauge on what I’m comfortable trying and then getting her approval on it. I’ve been looking into bupropion for several reasons, it seems perfect. 

I’m a smoker who moved over to vaping. I’m not actively looking for or trying to quit, but if it happens that’s neat. I can’t risk weight gain and I’m obese due to another medical condition (hormonal) and my obesity caused my brain condition, I quite seriously need to loose weight, if anything. That was my main drive in looking for an antidepressant, as I know a lot cause weight gain. I have excessive fatigue and oversleep due to my depression, 18 hours a day at least. I have no motivation or energy whatsoever and spend my entire life in bed. They are my main and major struggles with my depression, I’m not sad or suicidal, just incredibly tired and devoid of all interests or emotions. I also not a lot of antidepressants make you tired which is the last thing I need. That’s what’s leading me to bupropion.

Both of them have bad shit in their lives. Both of them have bad mental health. One of them has had bad panic attacks, and has isolated herself

I stay in touch with both, just asking them about their day. 

I don’t know how to deal with depressed friends. How to help them get better. Beyond a point, it affects me and makes me sad that my friends are hurt and they’ve become antisocial 

I want some suggestions about how i can manage this better

1bkst9s,gd041,1,0.0,1711089318,depression,"Am I being irrational? Last night I was talking with some friends and I went on a mini rant about how I don’t enjoy my job and how I’m stressed about needing to get a car for it. They said things like, “Just quit your job and find one that doesn’t require a car.”

I don’t know why, but that really pissed me off. I’ve put so much time and energy into saving and preparing for my first car, and to hear them say to do a complete 180 and do something else really struck a nerve.

I can’t just “quit my job”. I have bills to pay. And on top of that, I have no idea what I want to do. If I were to quit, I’d be unemployed and uneducated while living at home with parents at 20. So I’m sticking with my job because it gives me something to do until I figure it out (and it pays well).

I tried to explain this to them, but it must have not come out correctly cause they kept saying my logic was flawed and were making fun of me for not making sense.

Am I being irrational..?"

I don't want kids, I don't really have a desire ro get married, probably won't go to school for a higher education, and I live in my own head daydreaming.

I'm gonna give 2 examples of people I've cut off. First is someone I think everyone here would agree I made the right decision on.

So basically my best friend from high school. Eventually he found some other friends and became involved in some criminal activity. So I went from hanging out with him all the time to when he introduced me to his criminal friends, and then I felt the expectation that I also have to get involved in this criminal activity to hang with them. I wasnt going to do that and I wasnt going to accept being downgraded by my best friend so I cut him off.

Was I wrong for that? I really don't think so tbh.

Also it was serious criminality, not just smoking weed etc, which I was doing. it's shit they literally got arrested and charged for pretty recently.

But here's the second instance. Total opposite type of person. Super smart, super professional, and also one of my best friends. But basically what happened is I used to help him with his personal problems, as friends (supposedly) do. And he had quite a few, mostly relationship issues. But I never opened up to him about my personal issues because of my own insecurities, which I know is wrong. But one day we were both opening up and I did open up about my issues, and...I got ignored, basically. Dude basically said ""that sucks bro but...""

So I cut him off.

I already know most of you will say I'm right about the first guy, but I truly feel equally as strongly about the second guy. And yes I got a fake ""I'm sorry if I made you feel..."" apology from him. That cemented my decision to cut him off. Am I wrong? Am I sabotaging myself and my relationships?

What happened after the pandemic?
The huge change I haven't seen much talk about, Is that this generation is not well. Most kids daily talk about topics that are stupid, it's coming to the point where the children around me have matured to quickly.. I mean look at this point we got 11yos making jokes about mass tragedies, like racist jokes, or jokes about the twin towers, I get dark humor, but hide it from children... also not just dark jokes, it's also a bunch of adultery, like for example, in my school, cuss words have become normalized, so had uh.. ""weird"" jokes, my fellow students also do this joke around, where the hump the tables.. That is disgusting, also the word gyatt, is always used on my young female teacher.. it's mad weird.. I believe the cause for this huge change was due to kids having too much free time during the pandemic.. This change makes me feel sad.

How do I deal with it?
Well.. I try my best to fit in, as if I find these jokes funny, yet once I arrive home, I feel terrible...

A bit personal..
My family isn't the best either.. my father the other day got into a fight with me, I felt super bad on that day, and I texted my mom about, my dad tracks this, and out of nowhere, I get thrown on the ground and my shirt gets ripped. My brother's alright.. thought he is VERY VERY judgmental.. same with my sister.

I got an Addiction with those videos... It feels terrible.. the urge to watch those is going away but what I did in the past was crazy.. I did it for 5 times a day sometimes.. I don't even know how.. but I regret it.

I am medicated, completed two rounds of TMS, in an intensive outpatient program and none of it is doing much of anything.

I had career momentum, supportive family, spouse, etc. logically I tried to understand my depression, not that it’s possible to be understood. Depression doesn’t seem to be the right word for it. It’s a void. I can’t look away now. I stopped working. I started sleeping all the time. An anxious part of me fought to get help and try to find a path back to something. Anything really. I am fighting what feels like a losing battle.

1bkqjai,ziyal79,1,1.0,1711080469,depression,"Employment terminated due to mental illness I'm really struggling right now.

I was working for a legal aid organisation in my state (I'm in Australia, for context). I have PTSD and I told them that before I started. I had been having some issues at work because most of the work that was done was either dealing with domestic violence, sexual offences, or child abuse. It was pretty triggering. My manager at the time asked for permission to send a letter to my psychiatrist asking what modifications need to be made to help me to do my job. That's how it was pitched to me anyway. So I gave permission.

My manager sent a 4 page letter to my psychiatrist detailing all of the issues with my performance. They said I was inappropriate and rude with clients and stakeholders, and that I was unable to receive feedback, plus other stuff. I disagreed with their assertions, but I went through the process. They asked for further information in January, and my psychiatrist responded. Due to her response, my employment was terminated. They originally told me that it was proposed, but they only gave me a week to respond, which wasn't enough time to get another medical opinion, or legal advice, or even advice from the union. So I had to respond without the benefit of assistance. They refused my counter proposal out of hand, saying that my suggestions were too onerous or unreasonable (I asked for a secondment to a team that doesn't deal with the aforementioned material) and terminated my employment effective immediately. They are allowed to discriminate against me like this because my psychiatrist said I'm unable to fulfill the requirements of the role. So there's no avenue for appealing their decision, or going down the unfair dismissal route (I'm a law student, I read relevant cases while I was waiting for the union to get back to me).

I had also requested to not be on reception more than once per week because people would regularly call wanting legal advice about sexual assault, or trauma dumping about the abuse they suffered and it was upsetting for me. I didn't realise I was painting myself into a corner because work had made decisions to not allow me to undertake any other tasks in my role description except reception because they decided it would be triggering to me without consulting me or even communicating that they had made that decision.

While this was going on, I got my bloodwork updated. it turns out that I am so severely anemic that the HbA1c test they tried to do failed because I didn't have enough hemoglobin available for the test. This probably explains why I've been feeling so exhausted. I've been sleeping a lot. Even though it's been 3 weeks since this all went down, I don't have any appetite and when I do eat, it's not a lot. Oftentimes by the time I get to the end of the day, I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to feed myself. 

I'm waiting for unemployment benefits, which will be another 3 weeks at least. I'm applying for other work, but I've not found anything yet. I'm feeling like I'm losing hope and I am just experiencing periods of being completely beside myself and not able to stop crying or do anything. So I spend most of time trying to keep myself busy, I spend most of my spare time playing video games, which is a helpful distraction.

I'm basically just hoping that I'll find another job and feeling very scared about what's going to happen if I can't find anything. I'm trying to avoid thinking about the future too much because I can't actually cope with the idea of being unemployed. I also have an eating disorder, and not eating is exacerbating that as well, unfortunately.

I don't know how to avoid spiraling. Does any one have any advice?"

When I pull it into a ponytail it's about as thick as a nickel and i cant really even style it that much or style my bangs due to how much its thinned out. It's one of my greatest insecurities along with my weight. 

I've put on quite a bit of weight ever since I had my son but that was 5 years ago and I never have been able to consistently lose it. My depression hasn't been helping and while my partner has said that it doesn't bother them or that they find me attractive, comments like I'm boring or ""like a mom trying to relate to a teenager"" when i talk,  has me sort of spiral out and takes me a long time to get over it than it naturally should. I get stuck in this feeling of feeling old and fat and this ugly old mom when I'm only 24.

I thought I was getting a better handle over these intrusive feelings and insecurities. I got new bangs and felt a bit better about myself and even put on makeup yesterday and styled my hair that I haven't done in a long time.
That same day my partner and I went on a  picnic date but it ended up leading to an argument on the way home. I decided to get some space and headed back out to the park to just go lie on a blanket in the sun and just relax. I found a very secluded spot towards the end of the park with no one around except a group of teenagers hanging out in a gazebo maybe 60 feet away. I started hearing them laughing and talking very loudly poking fun at eachother at first before I started hearing them talk about the ""the big lady in blue"" and making comments about my weight and then just whispering and laughing with eachother.

 I was trying my best to ignore them and just get back to lying down and relaxing and closed my eyes before I heard running steps towards me and opened my eyes just to see one of the boys had leaped over me missing my face by a good few inches before laughing and saying that they just wanted to make sure I wasn't dead. I'm not gonna lie and say I handled it well and im not very proud of it but I called the boy an asshole before just getting in the car and heading home in tears. I don't know what I was expecting I guess some comfort when I got home but my partner was still stressed from our argument and struggles with their bpd and didn't take it very well.  When asked what happened I told them of my run in with the teenagers and they proceeded to get upset over what happened and in their words were trying to help me.  By telling me that I can't stress out over this and then started looking at my head and telling me how bad my bald spot has gotten and that I've let myself go. This had me crying even more and my partner got more stressed and told me, ""I'm just trying to be honest what do you want me to say, that you're beau..."" before stopping.

I'm aware that it's up to you to make sure you keep yourself in shape and that it's not fair to your partner especially since attractionis a major factor for relationships. But I guess I always convinced myself that it was fine because my partner said that my weight never bothered them and that I was fine the way that I am. I feel like the biggest lover and I'm stuck in this loop of resenting what I've allowed myself to become and feeling ugly and unattractive and just being disgusted with myself and then realizing I'm stressing myself out even more and making my balding hair even worse. I think I'm more grossed out of how sensitive I am and let myself just keep eating like shit for years and this whole time fooled myself thinking my partner thought I was attractive or okay with how much I let myself go. I know I got to get over it and start working on my mental and physical health but right now I feel like I can't move and just hate the person I am and can't get overwhelmed by everything that's wrong with me. I'm disgusted of the image of me putting food into my mouth so I'm glad atleast I'm not turning to food at the moment. Sorry for the crazy rant but it's more healthier venting this out on the internet then unloading this onto people I know."

I'm 20 years old. Recently I was givem medication for depression, however, I think it has made me worse. I cannot eat anything. (Normally I hate eating anyway, but this worsened it) I also can't get out of bed and spend hours at a time laying here. Everything I do just annoys me now. Tried to play games on my computer, immediately turned it off. I tried to draw, got sick of it. Tried to write, lost motivation immediately. Not to mention, I have chronic fatigue syndrome so that just makes everything infinitely times worse. 

I should mention that this medication is the second brand I'm on. The last brand I was only on for three days but I suddenly started self harming for a week straight. I've been clean for 12 days now, but now I'm so damn tired I can't even get up to hurt myself. I need to get out of bed, but I just can't move. I'm honestly thinking of just killing myself. Being alive is way too much effort. Taking care of myself, eating, etc. I'll probably tell my mum but I've never been this severely depressed before and idk what to do."

f647tsy,BloodyClash1133,47,,1572689495,depression, Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost
f5pnusx,,47,,1572363803,depression," I have to agree with this. I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier. 

I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that. 

Sorry for my rambling. That’s my two cents on the topic."
f5pq8wf,000000-,14,,1572365346,depression," Great rule! I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   
  
And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  
  
It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  
  
It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  
  
Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems."
f8wap4b,UnclePandaDoesReddit,9,,1574886674,depression," Thank you for posting this.... as much as I want to have a more personal connection with people here, I realize how that pre-disposes OP's to VERY bad advice and people who are suffering are often in an altered state that DOES NOT benefit others.

That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).

Love you guys so much, I wish everyone as much happiness as possible, especially coming up on the holidays."
f7nciyt,throwaway_12q,7,,1573895513,depression," I really appreciate this post! 

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha"
f9ju705,RastaNL,8,,1575385872,depression," I’m guilty of doing this and, as others have pointed out, it has always been out of goodwill but it is too unpredictable and therefore dangerous. Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; 
I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.

I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. 

After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.

Thank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out."

fadsdww,,4,,1575984906,depression," I agree ""pm me anytime"" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a ""I'm here to help message me anytime"" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it"
fb7bk7z,Wasteofskin50,4,,1576584061,depression," Wow. I understand that the rules are the rules, but you just painted *everyone* who offers that as either a psycho or a predator.

Now I have some hard thinking to do. Again, just wow..."
fm2exbp,Beverlydriveghosts,4,,1585696121,depression," Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. 

He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. 

A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. 

But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk."
f6xt54w,FluffyPanda42,7,,1573257785,depression," I personally don't come here looking for helpers or to become a helper for other people.

I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.

Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me (which is also why I'm thankful to this community, I can relate to people, they can relate to me)."

ff0wycl,Dabok,3,,1579473079,depression," Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.

I have been on both sides of this coin. As a ""helper"", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.

As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).

So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread."

ffj2fhm,bloodstainer,2,,1579988694,depression," > **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP.** 

This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.   


Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the ""PM you anytime"" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance."

fhacj48,,2,,1581404532,depression," This is the reason why I use large chat groups. Even with those who have been trained in supporting ppl,I feel they might get too drained out.

It's complicated cause he has personality issues too."
fk076ta,SimShade,2,,1583745148,depression," So on Twitter, I’ve expressed my woes before and the DMs I got weren’t really assuring. I get that people mean well but pep talks don’t really help. Because even though they mean well, it comes off as, “Hey, you’re a freak. But don’t worry, someday you’ll grow out of being a freak!” Empathy is so much better honestly, but not many people give that. That being said, this is a great reiterative step in the right direction. Thank you!"
fkat4el,mr_bigmouth_502,2,,1584018815,depression," I think I get it. It makes sense since I've helped people through difficult situations through private chats, and it can be extremely distressing when the person you're trying to help is suicidal. I'm not a trained mental health professional, and yet I've already dealt with enough of that stuff for one lifetime.

In the info section it's mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive, yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM.

Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences, i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed.

Although again yes, positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad-intentioned PMs, but i think i just need to share this.

I don't know if the english is too confusing or understandable though.

Anyway cheers for your wholesome effort 👊🏻"
fabkvr9,Cvlt_ov_the_tomato,1,,1575924762,depression," I agree, and I appreciate scorpionstanks and others good intentions. It's amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression. But agency/community contact is important. Everyone gets compassion fatigue. Having seen and heard our crisis coordinators, some of the most compassionate individuals I've met after a 12 hour shift. And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially. 

These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift."

fcmu8pj,,1,,1577792528,depression," *Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:

I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).
(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)

I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.
Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.

For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp 

Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:

""Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.
Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. 
Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.
 Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.
There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. 
I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.
Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.
They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. 
I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.
So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.""
                                                                                                         The mind of Sun

That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂),
And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.
I've even tried to ""end"" myself  (sorry for this) four times.
Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. 
After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.
I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.
I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.

Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. 
That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.
Regardless I do like to know all kinds people.
Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.
I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.
I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.
It's  the way I respect people's desires. 
Although, I know how hard it is. 


THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.
MY APOLOGIES HOMIES.
I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. 
THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.
I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.
I'm still a bit embarrassed for it.
Let me quote a hero:
""Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good""

""My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.""

You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.
Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. 

Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.
Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. 
You are far more than you think.
I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.

Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.
Why not? ;)

Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎
I send you all a Bro hug. 
You can.

2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being. Just saying.
I'll stick to the rule from now on."
fddd1q3,,1,,1578306438,depression," I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely. 

I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. 

Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. 

As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say ""*enough's enough*"". I'll stick to responding to comments in the public domain."

ff2hcz9,IdealCanADate,1,,1579506181,depression," It sucks, but I 100% agree with this rule. Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.

The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.
As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.
As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.

My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.

I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!

But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.
And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.
Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.

To all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you."

My private message asked the inquire's age up front with the statement I'd not tell all the facts of my story to a minor. They were 14 so ""apologized"" for asking... From my history, NOT my intent to belittle or dismiss any child/young person who might be struggling with similar historical casual agents & stated that. Thereafter, I gave only a brief summary of just the initial harsh facts. 
My end comment was that, honestly there was no way I could ""fix"" whatever they were dealing with, BUT that they had my ear as a safe place to vent.

In addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  

If you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when ""we want to help"", what it means is that ""we want to feel helpful"".  ""PM me any time"" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different."

I think that part of it is that a lot of posts are actually kind of comments rather than creations.  A surprising number of posts here are title-only, and we're not super-happy about that.

fhbbfkn,SQLwitch,1,,1581438811,depression," It's always difficult (and worrying) when someone gets attached to a resource or individual that just isn't able to provide the right support.

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that ""only X can help me"" and also that ""X has what I need"", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but ""PM me anytime"" does both those things.  

>  There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.

One of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly ""I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for"".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment."

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.

For the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.

Now when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.

Which is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.

I don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort."

fj8gnx3,SQLwitch,1,,1583112965,depression," > And I dont believe in anything, least of all any goodness in humanity. But do you believe any of that?

Personally, I think that humans defy generalisation.  I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  

There are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  

There are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.

But I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the ""developed"" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.

Sure, if the person is suffering from say a mix of diagnoses and is getting support from reddit for depression for his/hers self described situation, that can very easily turn badly if the patient in question is actually suffering from different types of mental health disorders and is currently self harming, that support can turn into support for those destructive tendencies.

My therapist told me that it might relate to something that had happen to me before that I forget but my conscious remembers it so well and it triggered my defense mechanism, but I don't recall anything relate to this fear.

Then I got scared.

I'm at a point where I truly don't know if I'm depressed or if I'm just used to it.  If the depression is in such a state where it's become normal and I'm just functioning.  Maybe it's a high-functioning depression?

Not knowing what it is or even if it is, is terrifying.  Because if it is, I don't know that it is, and I'd rather know than not know if it is at all.  Because if I didn't know all this time that it is, this is another level of depression, a new level, that I'm not used to, unfamiliar, and terrifying if it's working this way.

Oy gevalt.  Receiving a frantic phone call from a loved one and talking them down from the proverbial ledge when I'm already stressed out is not my idea of a fun afternoon.  Oh also when someone is depending on me to move an x,xxx lb machine and cinch it down for a four hour road trip without it falling and crashing and killing people.

This is why I have no dreams or aspirations.  I let my life be sucked away from me.  And it's my own damn fault.  It's not the fault of any one person but me.  I'm an adult now and I think I'll be dead or hopefully die in my sleep before I realize it.

I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth to a loved one because they're at a 10 and I need to bring them down as low as possible before they either hang up on me or we end the call as amicably as possible.  I'm saying the cliche's, proverbs, whatever I can grasp at that'll chill them the fuck out so I can get the fuck on with my day.  

Sound heartless?  Yeah, probably.  But you would sound so too if this were the umpteenth time you do this and the person doesn't take what you say to heart.  And you know what's fucked up?  I understand this because I'm guilty of this.  So what kind of ourobouros shit is this?  If I'm having to pay a debt because I wasn't good to this person earlier in life, okay.  I get that.  If this is just crazy shit I'm hammered with for a small widget of time, okay.  I can deal.

I'm getting mortar attacked because someone said some innocuous thing and somebody else took it the wrong way.

kf1tg1x,tomsp_666,4,,1703632838,depression," At the start of December I got the energy to return to my academy. Thought I could make a comeback from a one month hiatus. During that month I felt absolutely awful - I barely could get out of bed, I was drinking every other day, I abused my medication etc. I felt absolutely lonely, and lost. When you're 25, and have the desire to drop out of a higher education institute for the third time... It just makes you feel lost and pointless. I couldn't get to see my doctor, and I had the desire just to end up in a mental hospital

I actually felt decent at the start of December. Now, Christmas went by, and I feel like absolute trash. I was at my relatives house with my family the other day, and I didn't feel like I was there. It all just went by. I had a complete outer body experience. It felt like a dream. I guess that happens to you when you drink for like 4 days in a row.

I didn't take my meds for a while because it completely destroys your libido. It just feels like I occasionally need to experience self-pleasure because it takes you out of the constant negative existence. That's why I've been abusing alcohol, food, and drugs occasionally.

I just feel absolutely lonely - I haven't talked to my best friend for many days, I don't have any meaningful social interactions in my day-to-day life. Communication becomes a task when you have a few people wishing you a merry Christmas, like 4 people sending you meaningless memes, and some people I don't have the mental... push, I guess, to answer. Lately, most people get no answer from me. I obviously feel lonely because those aren't meaningful interactions.

I also feel envious at my best friend who has been in a relationship for some years, yet I've gone on 33 dates which has yielded nothing meaningful. You sit on tinder or bumble for years but nothing comes of it. I obviously don't believe that finding someone will automatically make you happy, but I feel as if some people get scolded for wanting to find someone when that's a perfectly rational desire.

I took three days worth of pills as of writing this, and I hope I don't have a good day tomorrow because at this point feeling terrible feels most natural to me."

I get that life changes and I completely understand why they no longer have as much time and energy to spare for me, I get that... But I haven't even once asked for things to go back to how they used to be, because I know that's not realistic, all I've asked is to not be ghosted because I have a history of friends doing that to me and it's such an awful feeling.

I completely get being busy and needing space and am perfectly willing to give it whenever needed, but why can't this person just communicate that to me? That's literally all I've asked, is to be given a heads up instead of being left alone in the dark to wonder and worry. Everytime this person ghosts me I worry myself sick, I worry that they don't want me in their life anymore, that they don't care about me anymore. I worry that maybe their personal struggles have gotten to be too much and that they've harmed themselves or worse. Everytime they ghost me I worry that I'll never hear from them ever again for one reason or another and it's so emotionally draining.

It hurts that I've told them this so many times, and all I ask is for them to try to communicate when they need to be alone, and they just ghost and ghost and ghost. And I try to tell myself that it's not me and that they're just going through their own struggles, but I'm just so afraid of losing the closest bond I've ever had that I can't help but overthink things and assume the worst. This person is so important to me and it feels like our bond has been slipping away from me the past year or two, and there's nothing I can do but wait to hear back from them each time and hope that they still value my friendship.

I just want one close relationship where the person doesn't do this to me, just one, and I always thought this person would be the one because they used to always try to be there for me like I've always tried to be there for them. So why is it that they can't be here for me now? Why is it that it feels like they've hardly been there for me at all for the past year and some change? It feels like I'm nothing but an unwanted burden who's not worth any of their time or energy anymore. Whether that's actually true or not idk, all I know for sure is I just miss my best friend. I just want to know that they're okay and that they still care about me, but all I can do is worry and wait.

**TL;DR:** Being ghosted over and over by my best friend who used to be inseparable with me, and I'm struggling to cope with it anymore."

kihj5ub,K4yr0,3,,1705609772,depression," This is a minor issue but for some reason I get super upset when someone online starts arguing with me. Doesn't even have to be about a controversial topic but them just being rude and overly personal, idk. I react so strongly to that and get stomach pains, it's so ridiculous. I kinda suspect it's because of social anxiety and me constantly worrying I could annoy anybody, anywhere, or ""misread the room""... which obviously isn't really possible if you're online and the room is huge and open to anyone. 

In the past this feeling was even worse and I didn't dare writing anything online. Today I still try to be careful which replies I read though it still happens now and then. The other person doesn't even have to be ""right"" or anything, it also doesn't matter how rare this is. If I meet 100 people who are nice and polite and 1 is rude then I'm still thinking about that person forever. There's also this feeling like ""everyone"" suddenly sides with that person and starts hating me, it's so weird. Probably also this ""misread the room"" feeling. 

Writing this down hoping it helps a little. Though also trying to spend less time on social media in the future."

kjq9fv1,K4yr0,3,,1706310196,depression," Had severe anxiety all week, about multiple things. It got so much worse today though. Had to pay a bill online which isn't a big deal for other people but very difficult for me. Took me hours till I even could attempt logging into my account... and then it didn't work. Not sure if I used the wrong number or mistyped something. Tried another number... was blocked again. All of this easily worked in the past. I'm awful with this stuff, and also got severe memory loss, so not sure if I missed anything since last time though there's not really room for error. 

Well, if you got three failed attempts you're locked out so I'm not trying my luck right now. I'm in such a bad mental state I couldn't make a phone call to unlock it again either, especially not on a weekend. Parents are coming home next days so I'm gonna ask them if I missed anything. Even though that scares me very much as well, and it will come with a lot of accusations and possibly yelling. 

I got nobody to talk to about this stuff. Extremely embarrassing but it wrecks me. One time asked former therapist for help but I'm scared to bother her again. 

Another option would be checking my emails again if I missed any important ones. Though there's mail anxiety. I'm super dysfunctional.

Edit: spent half the night awake, overthinking and having nightmares. It was better during the day but got worse during the evening again. In ""good"" moments I don't know if I'm handling it better or just repressing it hard. 

Parents called and said they'd come sunday. Hope that's still enough time. Had so massive waves of anxiety during the day, felt feverish and isolated. Plus constant stomach pains. Hope this can be resolved somehow and I can survive the next weeks."

I should just fucking kill myself. No muss no fuss. Stop being a bitch and just embrace the finality of peace. Nobody truly cares about me. I am alone. I am a freak. I can lie to myself, but that's all I am.

At least, at the bottom, there is a clarity. An appreciation for the beauty of the world, for it is the only thing that comforts me and does not rip away at my heart in turn.

k92rjir,wyswtf,2,,1699889062,depression," Second damn post for the month.

When things are feeling great for me, it always crashes right down instantaneously. 

Maybe I’m just not meant in this world for that kind of connection. Maybe this is the universe’s way of telling me that it’s never going to happen, and I should instead, process the reality that’s in front of me.

I’m so tired of constantly wanting to be heard, to be seen, and to just be. 

I can’t have it all, but sometimes I fucking feel like I barely even have anything. 

Fuck me."

It's been decades of problems and I'm just about ready to have them all pulled.  Except my fucked up face denies me from doing so.  I don't think my skull would support veneers.  One side definitely has an infection, the other side is ""tender.""  This happened last time.  I was hit with a double whammy root canal and filling.  I can't do this shit anymore.

I have a mole I scraped and desperately wanted taken off but now I have to focus on teeth shit.  I'm still going to the get it checked but I don't think I can take it off.

I'm going to start this week.  This always fucking happens.  When shit goes downhill that's the time my body wants to make things fucking worse.

I'm going to move heavy shit yet again.  The last slog in long and depressing tired haul.  Two fucking days of loading, moving, driving, hoarding.  I'm so tired of this.

And one day of the week where I can't get help for any of it.  And having to wait until tomorrow to be told I'll probably have to wait another week is agony.  I have to load up on Midol because it's the only thing that brings down toothpain.  Fuck period shit, this shit helps my mouth.

And all this mouth shit is happening on T-giving week.

I wait all fucking year for a nice, banquet meal and my mouth is going to be fucked.  I'm going to eat it but I can't just sit and enjoy it.  I'm going to force myself to.  I know I'm lucky I can eat at all, and I am thankful, but I'll be more thankful when all these problems are taken care of.

ka11twf,,2,,1700495798,depression," My birthday is this Wednesday with Thanksgiving the next day. I always hate this time of year. Everything is a constant reminder about losing my mom and how lonely I am.  My therapist just cancelled our appointment for today,  I feel empty and hopeless. I have no one to turn to. I just sit and constantly ruminate my bad thoughts or flashbacks from watching my mom die.

Honestly worried how I'll handle this week with my birthday and Thanksgiving. My last hospital stay was around this time 2 years ago. I feel like I'm going to end up back there. Everything I read says to turn to family and friends, I don't have either. Going to be alone for my birthday and Thanksgiving.

Can't shake the constant thought about wanting to die. I just want to stop existing. Every thought is painful. I get no relief from my angry, anxiety or depression. One of the 3 is always going at max speed. I never feel content. Everything just feels painful and pointless.

Edit: I probably won't talk to anyone for the next week. Especially with my therapist cancelling. I don't have friends or family and I despise the suicide hotlines."

Years of work leading up to a few congratulations and then nothing more. No development, no fun, nothing that's going to make my future life look any less bleak.

I really wish that I had access to an effective and quick way to commit suicide. With my mental health problems (which aren't just depression), I don't see a future in my field where I can survive financially or be okay personally. It just ends up being a dumb, dumb thing of keeping going because people will get sad if I go.

I do wish I could end it, I just don't know how. So I'll keep thinking about cutting my throat and I'll keep punching myself in the face. I hope it pushes me enough at some point. Fuck it all"

But now I realize there is no happiness anymore because tomorrow is existed. With this depression I can never be a normal person, and I've been diagnosed depression since I'm 12. It will never go away. It's uncurable. I'll feel torture like this for the rest of my life."

kom8tz8,Fireheart251,2,,1706896433,depression," Idk where to post this but just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm a home health aide and I got a client, a woman who lived with her son, near my house that I could walk to. I thought it was so convenient. Unfortunately today, my second day working there, when I started cleaning the kitchen I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye and I hear a weird sound. The living room is right next to the kitchen and there is only one bedroom where the mom sleeps, the living room appears to be the son's room. So I turn around from the kitchen and I see the son laid back on the couch, pants off, stroking his genitals while looking at me. I was like wtf and just turned away and kept doing my work. I wasn't really sure how else to react. I only looked briefly and was telling myself maybe I imagined it. I didn't look directly at him or make eye contact but I know he saw me turn my head and look for a split second. I just continued my job as normal and told myself this would be my last day working here. Crazy thing too is he didn't do this just once. The first time was when I was sweeping the kitchen. After he was ""done"" I guess, he pulled up his pants and went to the bathroom then came back to the living room. I went to get a mop and bucket to mop the kitchen floor and as I mopped he started touching himself again. I went to mop the bathroom and came back to wash the dishes in the kitchen, then he started again. Basically anytime I was in his field of view he started doing it. I would enter the room and his pants were up, then at some point they'd be down again. 

I know people are thinking why didn't I leave right away. Idk. I wasn't sure what to do, this was my first time witnessing such a thing, and on my job no less. I just wanted to do my work and get paid, I don't like confrontation, and I guess I'm not the type to freak out over such things. I was just thinking as long as he keeps his distance we won't have a problem. I finished my work the woman asked me to do but the problem was the apartment was very small, and after I was done with work I would've had to sit in the living room with the son, whereas before I was distracted/focused on my work and wasn't very near him. There was pretty much nowhere to sit anywhere in the house, not even in the mom's room, except the couch the son was masturbating on, my only option would've been to stand around in the bathroom the whole time, away from the living room and kitchen where the son was.

 The mom seemed pretty nice and I'd been doing this work for her, so after I finished my duties, I went to her room to let her know that her son was being inappropriate and she looked concerned but also imo not too surprised, as though she knew her son has done such a thing before. She told me she was sorry about it and I left, called my company to tell them what happened and now I have to go fill out a report which I don't really want to do, just want to forget about it. But yeah, I've heard negative things about this job field before but this was the first uncomfortable/disrespectful thing that has happened to me so far. Kinda upset because I liked being able to walk to work, but this dumbass pervert had to ruin it for me. Was too good to be true."
kotshew,ryov,2,,1707015184,depression," I feel like an outsider. I don’t feel like there’s any place where I really belong, or anywhere where I’m really wanted. I’m constantly just intruding on other people’s lives temporarily before I’m forgotten. While other people can form connections and friendships easily, I fail at all of it. I have no idea how to act like a real person.

I work very hard to try and counter this feeling and have had some practical achievements. I have a social group I help run, got into grad school and recently got a really good job. I interact with people every week. But I feel like I work myself to the point of complete exhaustion just to keep up the image that I’m doing something with my life and to maintain enough of a facade so that people won’t know how miserable I am day to day. I’m a total fraud.

Everything feels wrong. I don’t feel like my life has any value or meaning to anyone. I find it impossible to feel any kind of joy or accomplishment. I feel completely aimless and directionless, I couldn’t even tell you what I want to do in life, I don’t really think about anything beyond the immediate future and the next thing that my brain has decided will finally solve my depression once I achieve it (nothing ever does). 

I don’t think I can do this for much longer. I want to feel valued, I want to feel like I belong somewhere and have a place where I’m wanted, I want to feel like I’m capable of forming connections, I want to derive some kind of meaning from something in my life, I want to be loved. I want to feel.

Tomorrow I’m going to smoke a lot of pot, hope that gets me through whatever breakdown I’m having lately, and then by Monday I’ll put all the walls and my facade back up and act like everything’s okay. I guess I’ll just keep doing this until I can’t anymore. What a bleak existence. I'm so tired."

I love how all bets are off and, if I relapse, I'm more feral about it than I've ever been when I was self-harming regularly. It's not just neat cuts on my wrist.

It *is* cuts, but on my breast and inner thighs so they don't see. It's biting and stratching, and hitting my thighs hard as I can, and pinching my skin with a plier. 

It's not enough. I wish I was like Deadpool, and I could go apeshit on my body and it'd just take it and bounce back, but then I'd miss the scars and the wounds and the bruises and the mess. 

I'm numb all the time, and when I'm not I'm *angry* and for no reason. I hate that I'm so weak I have to resort to this only to deal with the stress of a perfectly average life. I haven't wanted to die for years, but...I don't think I want to, now, either. There's just some whispers of those thoughts, about how tired I am and finally everything could *stop*.

I need myself. I lost her for a while. in the end she's the only one that has come to save me. I kind of carry a belief that I am a part of the universe and stars, made of galaxy dust.

But, they asked a couple of times and I was trying so hard to figure out how to reassure them without saying too much because truthfully, I really don’t know if I’m okay or not. I’m glad they are caring and that they asked because it’s been a long while since someone asked.

But I’ve essentially resigned myself to keeping most of these thoughts to myself. I’m not sure if I’m okay. So far, living my life is like watching and listening to TV statics during the day and dreaming about suicide or listening to intrusive thoughts at night. I remember events in the past that I don’t want to remember and I don’t have any family that I can truly go to and trust any more. I don’t get what “happiness” is all about, as cheesy and lame as it sounds.

My depression and anxiety symptoms seem to be coming back, but my next therapy appointment is end of Feb, and I don't even know if my therapist can help much.

I just spent half of my day battling anxiety in bed, occasionally waking up to do some work. That's it. After 15 years of battling against poor mental health, I'm tired of this. Unbearable housemates and my uphill career transition battle are adding to my stress. I couldn't eat well and I sleep too much. Ugh."
k15klba,CryptoThroway8205,1,,1695058715,depression," I got into an argument with my 23 year old brother. He's been really selfish lately since when I ask him to talk or drop me off somewhere or anything really small he's always making excuses for why he can't do it. He'll say he'd rather not, or he's not good at talking to people, or my room is too messy and so is his if I ask for someone to talk to. Barely see him despite living next door to him. I'm much older and watched over him when he was younger all the time, giving him his bottle, even occasionally helping change diapers.  

Recently I asked if I could use his curry to make some curry (with vegetables I bought). He said no, since he'd have to buy more. I thought of this as a last straw. He's always critical of whatever I do. But fuck there's empty toilet rolls on the ground in the bathroom and have been for months even before I arrived. He's not some paragon of a person himself, can't even bring it outside the bathroom to the trash.  

I said fine I won't use his curry but not to eat the food I buy. He eats pb and j or whatever desserts I buy. Then he tried to say that I can't use the family's white car, that our parents own, because he uses it for work. He's been really possessive about the white car, the only one he's willing to drive cuz he's a spoiled little shit, for years. Wants to take it if he moves out but I know he probably won't move out. My parents don't bother him nearly enough.  

When we go dragon boating he says it's ok to drive there after we'd decided to go by public transit but only if I drive. He's always trying to get out of doing any work. He just doesn't want to drive or pay for parking. He tries to get me to fill up the gas tank even being so spiteful as to come back with a near empty tank since he accuses me of always using the car. The thing is, and I argue this, I mostly only use it for local trips 2 miles away, not hour long commutes to work.  

But whatever it's only $40 I go fill up the tank. He wants me to fill up the white car half the time. The car that was supposed to go to me. But he's the one who uses it like 70% of the miles, my mom using 20%, and me another like 10%. How is this fair?  

He says I can't eat anything he makes anymore. And then threatens me with an ""are you sure you want to go down this route?"" Honestly I'm not sure if this is even worth reconciling. He's my brother, we don't choose our brothers. And I don't even know how we turned out so different. Genes probably. I can never get away from him being my brother but I sure can limit how much I talk to him.  

He's 23. All these years of me giving him the good room, him giving me the shitty chair he broke, always leaving more desserts and junk food for him when we were younger because I know he liked them, taking him to the park, giving him only compliments and trying to help him, getting into games to try to play them with him, teaching him science, playing with him daily, letting him use my laptop from games when I got back from work during internships. Sharing it when we were younger and giving him more time. And now I find out he's just a prick who doesn't care about any of it.  

What do I do? If it were a friend I'd just cut the toxicity out of my life. Perhaps I let him get away with too much. Perhaps my mom let him become transactional when he was younger and that somehow developed into his narcissistic personality."

Maybe it'd have gotten better idk. Playing a game instead grinding levels. It's better to space it out over multiple days.  

Probably due to not going to the gym today.  

Little brother is a piece of shit. Pulled a knife on me cuz he can't ever back off or apologize. Entitled kid who wanted to cut off the edges on bread since he couldn't eat those. I guess leaving him the majority of the junk food for 9 years because he ate nothing else contributed to this entitledness.

Still well over 400. McD caramel sundae 350, mc-chicken 350. I want more today.  

But I'll just try to work out and not eat too much crap.  

A major issue is that I'm not good enough in my parent's eyes. They don't think anything is good enough. My mom won't visit my 90 year old grandma so they have a strained relationship as well and she revealed she views everything family does as transactional in the way she describes my uncle letting me stay with him for a few weeks.  

I've been gaming a bit. I could study a bit more software development stuff. Lambdas and something else.

I'm also looking to travel. Not because I think it's worth the price, but because it'd be fun and makes me more appealing to girls. It'd be like $500 just to survive a weekend for a festival in a HCOL city for a festival. I'm faking being interested in some girls and in travel so I can continue talking to them. There's nothing wrong with them. I'm just not over an ex. I'm hoping that by getting with them I can move on from my ex more."

A couple days back I watched a Youtube video where a father plays through her daughter's favorite RPG game after she committed suicide. It was obviously very heartbreaking, showing just how much her death affected him.  
  
Since then, I've struggled to get out of bed in the morning and struggled to go to bed at night. I'm able to somewhat distract myself by doing things I enjoy throughout the day, but it's bedtime that's an issue for the most part, and I can't seem to put my finger on why?  
  
I've never really felt suicidal. I've never known anyone who was suicidal. Every death I've had in my life was always peaceful, and apart from one aunt in her 40s, very elderly relatives. I have no desire to have kids any time soon. Just simply being in the perspective of someone who lost their only child at 13 in such a horrible way ruined me.

That's actually pretty common.  Thoughts of suicide can function like an emotional safety valve and in that case they're actually a coping mechanism.  ""I can always end my life tomorrow"" can help us to make it through today.  I personally got through about a decade of my life that way.

I’ve used several, which all worked great for me. 

I used Fluoxetine, Mirtazapin, Sertralin, Citalopram and now Opipram.

Recently I needed to switch from Citalopram to Opipram, because I’ve been taking Citalopram for so long that the Dosis couldn’t be be upped anymore.

Since then I’m feeling less tired and overwhelmed anymore.

I need to state that in my personal case I’m also struggling with an underlying trauma hence I’ve been taking antidepressants to help me with the PTBS symptoms, too.

So it might be different from what others will try to accomplish, but in counseling they’ll will always try to adjust the medication to the specific needs.

kdyh4cw,AtleastIthinkIsee,2,,1702939817,depression," I think the crux is it is identifying how I'm feeling at any given moment, and especially at a time where it's hitting me hard.  If I ""put a label on it"" if such a thing like that exists in that situation, I think *I think* that means I got it, I understand what's going on.  

Because if you're having a hard time and not knowing where it's coming from and therefore not knowing how to deal with it and move on from it, it's hard to be in a place of not knowing wtf is going on.  

But I'm with you in the sense that feelings are fluid in terms of how we are at any given moment throughout each day and it's difficult to pin it down as this-is-this or that-is-that.  I also don't think it's that simple.  I just want to stop wiggin' out in the meantime.  And I did eventually.  Bitching about it on the internet helps me get through it, I think."

k8hdsd5,obbelusk,3,,1699523776,depression," Thank you for the lovely answer 🙂

I'm on sick leave now, at least for a few more days. I'm staying with my dad.

I don't have any therapy right now, but I'm looking into a group for anxiety sufferers.

Yeah, I guess stumbling is natural, I just hate when that familiar feeling of dread and hopelessness starts to creep in.

Hugs to you too"
k81k58d,Monkeywrench08,2,,1699256261,depression, And thank you for your time 👍
k8hnaz5,Feministin,2,,1699530684,depression," Thank you for the lovely conversation. I’m feeling very blessed.

That’s great that you’re having time to resettle. I’m glad that you’re taking your time for yourself, too!

I’m so happy to hear that there is a group which picked your interest. It’s great to no longer feel alone anymore and get the help and support of others, which understand the struggle to begin with.

I’m feeling you, but at the same time it’s a sign that you’ve made it out before, because clearly in between you felt differently, right? <3

For me personally my depression has always a bittersweet taste to it, because I’ve felt saved through my depression before. My depression created a sphere around me, which covered my vulnerability. The moment I’m no longer depressed I’m feeling so much more vulnerable, but at the same time so much happier, too. I’m learning to accept myself and trying to be nicer to myself and to my depression, too."
kvyvzus,Distinct_Instance_38,16,,1711064473,depression," I never had that issue with antidepressants. Actually I really enjoyed sex on them when they induced mania.

  
Have you tried wellbutrin? That has a much better track record as far as sexual side effects. It was a slight improvement for my depression and as a bonus caused me to quit smoking/nicotine"
kvz63bp,Thin-Primary-8438,6,,1711068251,depression, I feel you. Lexapro is giving me the same problem except it’s all solo lol
kvzt14x,LeftysSuck,4,,1711077486,depression," For me, I just couldn't nut. Combo Viagra and Prozac and you'll be as hard as a titanium pipe and certainly can last for a loooooong time. 
And it wasn't impossible for me to nut, just really hard but damn, if I could, it was killer."
kw06ilu,KrisPalu,5,,1711084330,depression, Do you guys even have sex? My depression hasn't even let me have a proper hook up in a long time tbh
kvzovra,Groundbreaking-Fee36,3,,1711075682,depression, That’s why I don’t take any meds.
kvzzdn0,nsasafekink,3,,1711080478,depression," Omg I hear you. Cymbalta has ruined my sex drive. There’s just almost no sensation even in my crotch area. It’s difficult to get an erection and cumming seems like a dribble. Almost like it’s retrograde. 

I added in Wellbutrin and it improved the first few weeks but then went back to basically no sensations. 

Discussing changing the cymbalta since it also makes it damn near impossible to pee. 

It does tho really help the depression and anxiety. 🤷‍♂️"

kvz0ekd,20dollarwine,4,,1711066116,depression," Prozac messed with my libido a bunch, but switching to Wellbutrin made it better"
kvzmjp2,Ter-it,2,,1711074711,depression, I've experienced the ED particularly with Cymbalta. I also take Wellbutrin though so if I get really turned on I don't have any real issues. But otherwise it's a real struggle.
kvznf0z,calicokitcat,2,,1711075069,depression," There are many antidepressants, and there are some gene screening tests that can identify if you will have a reaction like you are describing now with just about every type of the med on the market. There is also little blue pills that seem to be very easy to get. 

As for enjoyment in sex; that’s more complicated. Perhaps a better antidepressant or a higher dosage will clear your mind enough to let yourself become aroused. Perhaps you need to explore your body and find what feels good to your body while your brain chemistry changes. Your brain is your most powerful and largest sex organ in your body, and you can always find a pathway to the deed if you really work at it. 

I had a neuropsychology professor in college whose partner was paralyzed from the waist down due to a catastrophic injury. This professor was a true mad scientist, and as such her brain-mouth barrier was non existent. You better believe she thought is about her sex life as a part of class. We discussed alternate pathways the brain can make to cover for a deficiency in ability. Even though the professor’s partner couldn’t feel their genitals, by stimulating them through the back door, they could stimulate the nerves closer to the spine where the genital sensory nerves were still intact, and he could experience an orgasm and ejaculate. 

That is to say, using toys during sex to improve the experience for one partner often improves the other partner’s experience too. And since I’m assuming you are male, you got a prostate which is the key to, like, the best orgasms and I know for a fact it works past antidepressants that suppress orgasm. Because I have experienced it."
kvztx01,justhistory,2,,1711077882,depression," The thing to remember with antidepressants is that different antidepressants are going to affect people differently. What has side effects for one person might not affect someone else. Unfortunately, it can be a little bit of trial and error. Wellbutrin has fewer sexual side effects, but I got a rare side effect with it and couldn’t tolerate it. For others, Wellbutrin works great. So again, everyone is different. Talk to your psych about the sexual side effects you are experiencing."
kw07f6f,Garrison1982_,2,,1711084865,depression, With most of them I found I couldn’t climax.
kvz2ppt,Porn_and_drugs_acc,1,,1711066977,depression," Had the exact opposite effect, been on multiple SSRIs and other supporting meds for years and it has made me ridiculously hypersexual. As others have noted Wellbutrin is one that doesn't seem to affect libido or sexual performance as much as others."

I didn’t trust antidepressants after that, and found that therapy was more effective for me. Not saying meds wouldn’t help you, of course, just my experience."
kw054zl,DreaJoyce,1,,1711083542,depression, why don’t u use viagra? or lower the dose of the pills? i think after a while it will go away. but yea im a female and it was always hard to finish on those pills

kw0gbmu,-dudess,1,,1711090825,depression," I'm a female on Lexapro and I still have plenty of orgasms. You might check different meds/dosages. 

Also remember sex is more than cramming your penis in her vagina. It's not impossible with a soft dick, you just have to learn how to work with what you have."
kvz6zvm,workoutandfish,-8,,1711068595,depression, You have other issues if you have ED problems. Antidepressants will either make ya horny 24/7 or make it so you cannot orgasim. My current antidepressant allows me to preform like a pornstar for a very long time.

kvzon8x,Porn_and_drugs_acc,1,,1711075582,depression," Medication is different for everyone, my long term meds were Wellbutrin, Rexulti, and Cipralex. I tried others but never stayed on anything else for more than a couple months."

kvzzg4p,Inevitable_Long_6890,3,,1711080514,depression," Lexapro gave me wild dreams of killing my whole family. Like super vivid, I'd wake up scared af thinking it really happened. I told the doctor that and he said son...... stop taking that medication immediately no taper lol."
kw091lf,DarthNoobian,2,,1711085872,depression," With lexapro, I let my entire life fall apart and I didn't care one bit. That's the worst thing about anti depressants.

kvzs1bl,workoutandfish,0,,1711077042,depression, I'm just saying you could have other issues not related to the antidepressants

The ones around you are always priority number one, especially if it’s family. Don’t let these people down, but don’t fail to recognize if you feel let down. Communication is key, again, I wish I knew this. Learn to talk, but more importantly learn to listen. If you have a partner who is trying to make themselves heard, hear them. It can be hard sometimes because you feel like you’re hearing the same thing over and over. Maybe you are, and that’s the problem. Listen to them, ask if they need help, what you can do for them. The less they’re stressed, the less you become stressed. Pick up the slack by doing some chores without asking, try to make a habit of it. It feels rewarding the first few times you do, then it starts to feel routine. Life can get easy for you if you make it easy. It’s your life so it’s on you to change how it goes.

Trust me when I say not having really done anything or accomplished anything at your age isn't abnormal. Now to the extent to which you haven't done anything is a bit extreme but at least you can say YOU didn't make that decision. At least you don't have to live with the fact that you're the reason you haven't accomplished anything. I had all the opportunity I could want really and I wasted it. I TRULY wasted it.

I'm currently clawing my way out of a deep depression and even just today I asked myself why should I keep trying? My life has been good for nothing so far so who's the say it will get any better? Then I reminded myself that it's ME. IM the one who says things will be different. I have to make that decision for my own sake. No one else can live my life for me. Life is scary. But it's even scarier watching it pass me by. I'm done with that. It won't be easy but at least I can say I tried. I'll have days where it feels like too much and I want to give up. I'll have shitty days where I don't do jack shit and I'll feel bad about myself. But I'll fight to have at least one more good day.

kw08o97,The-MarshMallow_MAN,1,,1711085643,depression," Okay, to be frank, you had a fucking tumour in your actual head for the majority of your life brother, of course your life is different to the vast majority those in your age bracket. And, on top of that, you lived in the middle of fucking nowhere, so, of course you weren't out there having a million dates, hooking up with pretty people, partying or climbing mountains. You probably went to school, came home and went to bed and that was life. Brother, that's normal, safe even. And to parrot what everyone else is saying, and believe me, it annoys me as much as it may you, they're right when they say you have your whole life ahead of you. I thought I was so lost at 20 being in a small town and now that I'm 23 (only three years further down the track) I can see they were right. I just needed perspective. Don't look at life as levels you ascend through all together like you did in school. Everyone scatters in every fucking direction and tries things out, you can too. You have your health now, you have taken back a valuable part of you that changes the entire way you experience this world. You have plenty of time to make YOUR.OWN. WAY in this world brother. Don't look at your peers to figure out if you are where you should be in life, you have to look inside yourself to figure that out. Ask yourself the questions ""am I happy here?, does this job work for me?, do I want to do this for another 10 years? What is a giant goal I can strive to achieve? How can I break that goal down into actual real steps for me to achieve it?"". Don't rush yourself. As long as you wake up, you've won, everything else is a bonus. You'll be okay my friend."

kw0bzgt,No_Flounder5538,2,,1711087795,depression," Weed can help with physical symptoms, but it can also be detrimental to your mental health. Even though people use it to help with anxiety, it can make your anxiety worse when you aren’t using it. I’ve been in and out of Mental Hospitals for a bit, and every other patient I have talked to has told me that weed is great until you become reliant on it. You can’t relax without it and you feel like you are on the verge of a panic attack if you go long periods of time without it. I’m not gonna act like I know your entire situation, but you clearly need something to help with your pain. Most painkillers are highly addictive and can be very dangerous. Just as, if not more dangerous than weed. It sounds like your parents don’t fully understand why you use it, and if they do, they aren’t giving you other options. I think they are just worried about you, but don’t know how to help you.

My advice would be to research all of the negative side effects of weed and to research other ways to relieve your pain. Talk to your psychiatrist about painkillers and which ones might help you. Keep your parents informed on the whole process, mainly for their peace of mind. Just be safe about it and don’t just keep using weed because it is easier than other options."

No matter how many times people tell me that life is worth living, and doing things I love doing that makes me happy makes it worth it, but I don’t believe them. The only reason why missing out on doing something you love might be bad is because you would regret the missed experience. But I won’t feel that if I’m dead.

So do you leave your friend after married? If yes, that's understandable because you have a lot of responsibility for your family. But it comes with consequences like i explained above.

kvyuqp8,RichardsLeftNipple,3,,1711064013,depression," Friendship is very similar to dating. If you don't spend time with people, you don't have a relationship with them. 

The easiest way to meet new friends is to pick up a social hobby that you show up to regularly. Not everyone there will want to be your friend. However, spend enough time there and it probably wouldn't be too hard to find some decent people. 

The next test is of course spending time outside of the hobby. Some people only want to be friends through the hobby, some people don't have time for anything but the hobby. Every once in a while you get lucky. 

Like all things worthwhile, you need to make time for it. Stuff doesn't just happen on its own.

I'm also very introverted and can't open up easily, I think that's why I instinctively keep people at large. It's something I have to work on. (doesn't help that my favorite hobbies are reading and videogames, generally lonely activities haha). 

Anyways don't be so hard on yourself, most of the people I know gradually got more engulfed in family life, it's something that does occupy most of your day and if you're not an energetic or outgoing person by nature, it's gonna be tough. It's a good thing you realized you want something else besides family! I don't have much advice because as I said in the beginning, I too need to work on myself. But you could try maybe joining some of the events you mentioned. When an acquaintance is going to attend, maybe casually ask them about it, mention that you're curious and would try it out.

I'm in my 30s and married to my beautiful wife with a son on the way.

I noticed after I got married, I just started getting ostracized by all my ""friends."" I mean, it actually started happening when I first started dating her. The truth is these people were always assholes to me and I just permitted it.

I'm too ""low rank,"" and my wife happens to be quite physically attractive. I've only ever had any success in dating when it's women completely ""outside"" of my circle that don't know any of these ""friends.""

You know, most people these days are just shitty. Robin Williams said it's better to be alone than around people who make you feel alone.

The older I get, the more I realize it's a waste of time surrounding yourself with people who have a high school mindset. Most large ""groups"" are like toxic popularity contests full of fakeness. It might sound cliche, but it's fucking totally true. The bigger a ""group"" gets, the more fake, cringe, toxic, and cruel it gets.

It's much funner just doing stuff with your family. Go camping, go to a theme park, go pick some strawberries at a U-Pick or something. If you pick up a few friends along the way, great. If they turn out to be shitty, ditch 'em. Keep your group small. Fuck being around insecure assholes trying to enforce some social hierarchy."

However, I no longer feel that desire to have friends because I have a family to take care of and I have devoted myself to them. They are the ones who will always be there for me and they love me with every fiber of their beings. 

What more could you ask for? Friends come and go, I’m okay with simply having acquaintances. I already have the people in my life that really matter.

kw05vjw,salemlambda,1,,1711083959,depression," Sorry that you've been struggling, your depression sounds very intense.

It sounds like you're getting proper help, so that's really good, even if it isn't helping much.  Hopefully it starts to help more soon.  One thing I wonder, is if it's possible for you to find some kind of outlet/passion/distraction to keep your mind away from the void.  Don't pretend it isn't there, because you know it is, I think acceptance might be important, for now.  Hopefully you can fight it indirectly at first, by avoiding it and healthy life changes/treatments.  Once you get better, maybe you'll be able to tackle things more head-on and fully take back your life.  The way you describe it is like the eye of Sauron in LOTR, that must be horrible dealing with on a constant basis.

I hope you find some relief soon and are able to make more progress.  I hope you can reduce or get rid of the alcohol/weed, as those things might be making things worse.  The internal shaming and insulting sounds very unwarranted, so I hope those types of thoughts go away as well.  You deserve happiness and peace.  It's very good that you're accepting treatment, and I hope you continue to fight."

kvxun4d,Irefang,2,,1711051532,depression," Feel you on this one. Definitely going through a spiral so no quick decisions. But yeah, life is garbage for those of us abused, those that weren't can't understand how our thoughts internalize and force more negativity. Those of us that were either become monsters that perpetrate the pain back on others to reduce theirs, or suffer with what they have been through while it drives them insane. 

As for wanting but not being able to take care of children, fuck that sucks, but it's not your fault. Unless you were born in a good position or got lucky in life, the odds of being stable are near zero. I know that I did everything right in life but just got shat on repeatedly. Molested, abused, and abandoned by my family at 22. Worked while I went to college, internship at a hospital, worked for TX government (fucking tragedy of a state to live in...), and what do I have to show for it? Debt, unsustainable pay, and crippling depression thats sucked all joy out of life.

Others who say it gets better are lying to themselves and you.  It can get better, but at this point it won't be in any meaningful time frame for it to ever matter for current generations."
kvy5pru,KeepoPerMinute,2,,1711055178,depression," you sound burnt out, and I know the first thing is to blame yourself, but it really isn't your fault.

kvzaq0w,Rikkely,1,,1711070034,depression," Feeling excluded like that hurts. Especially when you have excluded yourself, only waiting for a subtle invitation to get back in (I know we don't like to think of it that way). Cause maybe they didn't actually hear your input or comment.

I want to say that you be you. Be yourself, don't give a F what others think. I remember getting passive like that when I always tried to adapt to everyone else just to fit in. Looking back I actually believe that they would appreciate me more if I was just me, not trying to fit in. Later I have realized that I don't give flying F what I am and who I'm supposed to be though. They do they, I do me and you do you. 

I really doubt it, but if you are you and you still don't feel accepted, find someone else. I promise you, there are so so so many people out there who accept you, not who you are trying to be. In the end people who are actually understanding this life accept others and their experiences, and get enriched by it too."

I think about how it was back in the 80s/90s and can appreciate the wonder I had as a kid about so many things because I didn’t have access to all the information.  Lack of access made things more special.  I wouldn’t say I loathe the modern world because there are many benefits that we enjoy now that simply wasn’t possible then, but I would definitely go back to the 80s/90s over this bs."

If I was too afraid to cry in front of them, or if I felt like I needed to keep certain things hidden from them then I knew they weren’t right for me.

It took a lot of time sitting in my filth alone to work up the courage to try a new clinic with a different pool of therapists. A good therapist was there to help me process the harm done by a bad one. Therapy is supposed to be healing, and no one should have ever made you feel that way <3"

kvxs58l,Turbulent_Scar_2325,5,,1711050709,depression," So I have been in a position where I witnessed a serious car crash. I helped as best I could and called emergency services. Very different to your scenario but the police treated me like a criminal. I was kept at the scene for hours, had to go in for statements and to check all my documents, then give evidence at court. I really lost trust in the police and you realise quickly how shit the normal officers are. 

However I think you need to try and have faith in the system. Yes it’s fucking horrible when you r treated like a nonce for trying to prevent a crime. Everything you do online leaves a trace no matter what you do. They will be able to find out exactly what you were looking at and what you searched for. The truth will come out and you will be exonerated.

Be careful who you share this with. It sucks but people believe rumours and this could ruin your life if you get labelled as a nonce. You need support but stick to close family and people you can trust 100%."

As someone who would kill for a friend, letting them vent is never as off-putting as it feels for the person venting. That lashing out is your brain keeping you in that vicious cycle.

The first one you mentioned, I relate to. I got rid of a bunch of old friends from high school this year. We are all in our mid-30s now. They’re now all felons, thieves, drug dealers… just really awful people. I’m totally ok with not associating with them any longer. I’m not better than them; I’m just done. I’m 34 now and I want peace and stability in my life. 

Second one is difficult to say. Your friend was dismissive of you for sure. But also, most people don’t really realize that they are poor listeners. I don’t personally want to be so picky that I am friendless."

With the first friend, I would not engage with him in person in any way, but you could try just being social media friends. I personally would cut the line off if he’s trying to pull you in to doing criminal activity or asking for money. That kind of stuff. The second friend clearly is bad with expressing emotions and bad with communication.    You could ask him to go to communication therapy with you."

I know it sucks because you liked this person, but relying on others to make you happy will only disappoint you. It’s something I still struggle with at times.

kvzsf75,Mundane-Aide3843,1,,1711077211,depression," Depression can take many forms. I had a stage of my depression which followed “It can’t feel any worse than this” which was “feeling nothing at all.” Which, admittedly is a worse experience, but I like to assume it was my brain’s way of escaping that intense pain and sorrow. As someone with both anxiety and depression, I can’t speak on depression masking my intense fears (it simply doesn’t). But depression was the result of me storing all my suffering until it was all I knew, then all I wanted, until my brain shutdown entirely. The chemicals in your brain are sometimes determined by important factors like stressors or trauma, and your brain copes as best as it can."
kvz3l61,Rikkely,3,,1711067306,depression," I respect Mr. Luther as much as the next person, but what if you just don't? What if you just stop? What if you just sit down? 

I ignored my depression for many years by focusing on always moving forwards, no matter how. Running, walking, crawling. I never just sat down and never just accepted the moment. I could not and would not, cause that hurt, it hurt real bad. So I continued - I ran when I could, I jumped, I skipped, I ziggyzaged, I crawled, I wormed. I did everything to not stop. Eventually, stopping made me realize - shit, something is really wrong with me. The feeling of just sitting down made me literally want to end it, so I kept on going. 

Don't keep on going until you know you can be at ease with yourself. Only then can you actually go on and push. Until that point, calm down, stop."
kw05ysy,SquirrelFuture3910,1,,1711084010,depression," You stop crawling. You rest. You feel….really feel what you need to feel. I applaud the runners/walkers/crawlers, but my shadow is my shadow and I can’t “just keep going”. That’s exhausting. Take a break, friend.

kw0ftnl,Dramatic-Ad-3620,1,,1711090469,depression," well actually being on acid is like pretty intense depending on the dose, stuff starts moving around and you get like a ghosting effect of different colours around everything almost like a really heavy chromatic aberration. things like faces look all bubbly and blotchy and very high def etc. but the feeling i think is completely dependant on the person. i found it stimulating and like overly emotional and thought intensive. and it felt like layers of my conscious were being peeled off the more i did it, to the point where i was literally a 10 year old kid again. i actually got left in a somewhat childlike Mindspace after i stopped, where id get overly emotional and pissy about stuff. feel like ive grown up all over again in the past couple years. but now this has happened."
kvy9tp8,KeepoPerMinute,4,,1711056561,depression," It sounds like an anxiety similar to Agoraphobia, about the fear of escape from certain situations to a known comfort zone.

I overcame this by always having a plan of escape for every situation, like for example, i would always just drive everywhere and my car would be nearby so i knew if i felt uncomfortable i could always drive away, or even use my car as a safe zone. 

Basically, just make sure to assign yourself a nearby safe zone if you go out, and eventually it will get better and you know you can always go to a safe zone if you feel uneasy."

kvzd80c,Rikkely,2,,1711070991,depression," One thing is for certain. If you master how to mask your feelings you will be successful, for five minutes.

You be you, and if the people around you can't handle that, find other people. (If you disagree, please don't read further).

How often haven't you seen others in your situation. You know that there are probably millions with ADHD.

E.g. meds are used to control, to sedate and to conform. I do not have ADHD myself, but I believe that if we continue to look at it as disease or some kind of problem we lose a lot of potential. 

I am sorry that I don't have the insight to give you advice on your questions, but it hurts me that you feel like you have to mask it. You are so beautiful when you are yourself. Get angry, love, laugh, smile, cry, get frustrated, get confused (cause wtf is this society created by people who want control anyways. It must be more normal to be angry, confused, uncertain etc.). Feelings are so scary for many people, they don't know how to handle it. Just be a human being...

  
I can also understand that it is hard to live with, to always have to work to like fit in or do the right things. I wish it wasn't like that. I do not know which troubles your diagnose brings you, I just hope you will be OK, or even better, I hope you will be happy."
kvzuvwm,Porn_and_drugs_acc,1,,1711078322,depression," Meds can definitely mask your feelings, my meds completely got rid of any emotions I had which can be great for some people but I would not recommend it for anyone.

Daily commitment to exercise and packing an interesting and healthy lunch. Having things that help me de-stress. Also finding ways to get these essentials without being bored. Example: if you’re tired of a daily walk, go for a swim, or bike ride.

Sometimes it also means a medicine change for me. I was prescribed a mood stabilizer for the first time today. I took my first dose 5 hours ago. And wow, I’m already starting to feel better. No stomach issues or headaches or nausea like I had with SSRIs."

I’m not sure your age … but life may have so much to offer you and you will never know if you don’t live it. Pain takes time to heal. Please give yourself more time. A breakup sounds rough, but it may help you be able to focus on yourself a little more. Start with small things. Listen to a song you like, read a book, reach out to a family member, watch a comfort movie .. anything self soothing. When you feel a little better, take the next step…. Take a shower, have a meal, get some rest. Baby steps. Please don’t end your life over temporary sadness. Also… God LOVES you, JESUS loves you. God has a plan for you. If you don’t know him.. try reaching out to him, he is waiting to hear from you. God promises to be close to the broken hearted. Jesus said “come to me, and I will give you rest.” Relationships can be overwhelming when you need to focus on self care: how can you care for someone else when your mind body and soul need you to focus on YOU. ❤️❤️"
kw0fro0,Swimming_Ad725,1,,1711090430,depression," He loves you through the dark times, those people are rare. you would’ve probably done the same for him if it were the other way around. If he says he wants to stay let him! He can make his own decisions, trust him in that.

kvzgnix,BringMeBackATshirt,2,,1711072331,depression," Look up ""The Cycle of Grief"" or the five stages of grief, this will give you an idea of where you stand in your situation.  I have found you can apply this cycle to most things, but it is based off of failure and loss.  Even with this example, the process takes time and depending on the person it can take longer to achieve acceptance.

Acceptance is just seeing the truth in the madness.  Accept the truth and move on with life."
kvwj53x,StfuJohnny,4,,1711035991,depression," Depression changes your brain chemistry, and medication just helps to even it out and get it back to normal. So yes, it’s definitely okay. And if you feel like you no longer need them later on when you’re in a better place, you can slowly come off of them. 

I’m personally on fluoxetine and they’ve worked really well. 

Definitely talk to a doctor before getting anything, but most will prescribe Fluoxetine (Prozac) or sertraline (Zoloft) for mild to moderate depression."

kvwqep1,mrmeanah,2,,1711038427,depression, There's no overcoming it. There's just learning to deal with it and there's tools (medications) to help. In my personal opinion I wish I never started ssri meds. I feel the same way on them as I did off them the only problem is the ssri have intensified my depression so I really have a hard time getting off them..... To the point I don't even bother trying anymore. I just take the damn things . Every time I've tried tapering I've just ended up in the hospital with extreme panic attacks (never had anxiety issues till I started ssri). It's kinda a debate on what I'm saying but I really believe ssri meds have messed me up to the point I need to take them to function properly.

kvwib84,Frosty-Site1879,2,,1711035713,depression," I only can tell you to look for a decent psychiatrist before even starting any medication, you could have any other thing which is not depression and antidepressants could fuck you so hard it would be hard to recover. 

Look for recommendations and try to make him test you just in case you don’t have depression"
kvwg3k1,missmillierene,1,,1711034964,depression," If you’re not currently exercising, start doing something no matter how small. There’s nothing wrong with taking a medication for this, it doesn’t even have to come with a permanent mentality. This may just be a time in your life where you need a little extra help and that is normal. There are many different medications, and I won’t sugar coat it, sometimes they come with a side effect you dislike. Some of them are worth sticking out, sometimes you’ll want to stop taking it right away. The first one may hit just right, or you may need to try another kind. There are different classifications, it may help to do some research on their differences. Talking to a psychiatrist is the first step, be open and honest even if you think something may be irrelevant, it do shy hurt to bring it up. They know best which ones may best be suited for what you’re dealing with. Deep breath, there are solutions waiting for you. Do some research and educate yourself, stay openminded and self advocate if something just isn’t working."
kvwm7md,NeatBlacksmith8180,1,,1711037026,depression, Medicines do come with serious repercussions. Be wise.
kvygz08,Black_prince_93,1,,1711059021,depression," There is nothing wrong with taking medication for depression. However, I would strongly advise that you seek professional help first, talk to your doctor, and follow their guidance. Know how you feel as I've been down that route since 2014 and took lockdown for it to finally get the better of me.

Talk to someone about how you feel first as that will begin the recovery process. Depending on how the doctor assesses you will dictate whether or not to put you on anti-depressants and what type. I ended up taking Citalopram in liquid form (can't swallow tablets at all). 

What they do is simply alter how your brain is working and helps to lift your mood so you can carry on with a normal routine. I was on them for over a year before I decided to wean myself off it. Don't just rely on them alone. Make sure you do things to make yourself happy."
kvzhdup,Acrobatic_Dot8469,1,,1711072624,depression, I don’t think I could function without medicine for depression.
kvwtvt8,Loud-Visit3208,1,,1711039559,depression," Medication should be your very last resort, truly. If you've tried everything to better yourself and your life is going great on the outside, yet you're still feeling terribly depressed, go see a psychiatrist. Antidepressants are handed out like candy, and often times aren't followed up with. So many people end up on meds for years who shouldn't be. These meds are powerful and are meant to be temporary aides, not lifetime dependency."

kvyt8l2,kytaurus,1,,1711063461,depression, What is the basis for your opinion?
kvz5psk,Rikkely,1,,1711068106,depression," Your abusive relationship. Do you have any sense of if that is before or after you began feeling like this?

None of us have the fight in us to actually beat this. It is the really sad truth. My therapist also told me in like the second session. ""don't expect to get well, just maybe a little bit better"". I am thinking like ""OK"" I'm just here instead of contemplating what else I would do. Do you really have to give me the bad news up front like that?....

I am also at the point where I have realized that all the work has to be done by me, even if I am getting some help from a therapist, there are no shortcuts, no pills or substances that can help us. We have to beat this the real way. And that is really really hard, we are not equipped to do that, at all. There is actually a reason why we are feeling like this, we are all ready overwhelmed. Another fight is just to much.

My relationship with my kids, me being their father is the only thing that keeps this human alive. I cannot imagine how people without those relationships do it. They must be so incredibly strong, I can't even imagine...

This might not apply to you, but I have realized that the ones before me, my guides, my tutors, my elders, have failed me. This would not have been an issue in my adult life, but since it happened when I was a defenseless child it left deep scars...

  
Again. I do really not have it in me, but something is not letting me go. You can really make it as well. Please let me help if I can."
kvz26t0,Rikkely,1,,1711066783,depression," Please understand that what your are feeling is not imaginary. Depression is not some thought process you have lost yourself in. Depression is, according to my understanding, a mechanism that the body employs when another solution would be to give up and be immobilized. You are fighting, giving it your all.  It's really hard work and you should be proud every day you wake up and get out of bed.

If there are days that you cannot, please don't judge yourself, we are only human, even if giving in is hard. We try our best. Don't let your best lead to more dire consequences, seek help. It will not solve your problems right away, but it might help you cope and hopefully help you in the long run.

  
Don't give up. You have made it this far, get your mind some help, you really deserve it. And I mean really, help. Don't settle for meds. Find the cause. It's there no matter how hidden."

kvydiyw,KeepoPerMinute,1,,1711057813,depression," It is important to find free time for yourself mate. 

Like, remove yourself from your usual day to day surroundings, take off to a park or just somewhere you can just sit for a while. 

I know you will feel like you are wasting your time, but use this time to think about you, who you wanted to be, where you are now, and where you want to go now, and the person you want to be. In the long run, it could save you a whole bunch of time, and lead to something you enjoy."
kvynrf4,RaiseCareless1187,1,,1711061466,depression," Therapy is there to validate you. They are there to help you set goals and expectations that help you become a better person.

Most of the time though, while they can help you with suggestions.. you will have to do the work to have a better quality of life"
kvywfr3,KeepoPerMinute,1,,1711064636,depression," Therapists are people with jobs, and helps to remember this.

kvyxitf,Rikkely,1,,1711065037,depression," Yes. If you have the opportunity do it. It might not work miracles, but it provides a safe space. What many people don't realize is that there are so many levels of depression. Depression is not just one thing. Get help as early as possible. You might get well, you might feel at ease with yourself, you might feel calm.

My belief: Depression is not a disease, it's a coping mechanism. It's brilliant. You can still read and write and do small stuff. What's underneath can not. Your body and mind is coping with something. Figure out, with a therapist, what your body is coping with. It can literally save your life."

Is it natural to not be in a state of happiness. Happiness tends to happen looking back at these memories we are normally not ima perpetually happy state. You have forgotten what it means to be happy. Learn to breathe in the moment. And be content with being."

kvxd0lb,TooMuchFlight,2,,1711045742,depression," I am in a similar situation. I could have a relationship, and sometimes pursue it, but I always pull back into isolation. Sometimes I make excuses in my head, I say I'm too complicated or people can't really understand me. In reality I'm just afraid to live again, but I don't even allow myself at least to really live in that fear. There is something about isolation that pulls some people, the comfort of it, in a way it helps us cling to childhood, to avoid life and time and age and responsibility. I can't speak for the reasoning this happens to others, only to myself, but for me it is that I could not deal with the pain of my failure so I began to dream while I was awake. 

There isn't really any reason for loneliness I think, that is valid. One can never be lonely if they're really living their life. Loneliness is a punishment, or a driving force telling you you need to get over your fear and live."

Secondly, if you're failing/having a hard time, THATS OKAY. The body has a weird way of handling overwhelming stress.

The first thing you need to do is tell your teachers. I promise they aren't monsters. Instead of seeing a failure student, they'll see a student that's doing their best to keep it together in the most stressful time of their lives.

You. Need. Sleep. Good sleep. Make sure your room is clean. Make sure your sheets are washed and smell decent. Try your hardest to get 8 hours of sleep every night, with a MINIMUM of 6 hours. No caffeine past 1pm, no food within 2 hours of sleep, no phone or TV within an hour before sleep, and drink a big glass of water 30 mins before sleep.

kvr10py,TheRowdyRavens,57,,1710950851,depression," I was in the same boat when I was little. I considered committing suicide for years. I even had a plan to commit suicide in a forest so my family didn’t have to find my fresh corpse. I hoped I would have just gone missing or someone else stumbles across it. I used to struggle with suicidal thoughts for years, I thought that nobody understood me. I was constantly picked on at school by teachers (not the students), isolated from my peers because I had undiagnosed mental illnesses, and as constantly fighting moodswings, anxiety, dealing with sexual abuse trauma from my male “friend” at the time, etc. the whole package of it. 

School absolutely sucked the fucking life out of me. I don’t even remember school besides the constant bullying I experienced from staff. 

I’m glad I didn’t commit suicide though. It is a huge uphill battle, don’t get me wrong. It took me looking in the mirror (metaphorically) and looking at the broken, shattered, and disgusting version of myself I was. Despite everything that happened to me, it was still me. You have to pick yourself up and fight. Nothing will change if you allow yourself to lay down and rot. The only thing that helped me personally was getting medicated, asking for help from professionals, and fighting every day to distract myself from wanting to kill myself. 

Please don’t do it, this will be simply just a short period in your life. Right now, it feels like your world is over but I assure you you’re going to look back at this and be like: thank god its over but I’m still here. I’m still me. 

The future is unpredictable and I found a lot of beauty in that. Committing suicide forces so many doors closed before you can even begin to take your first steps towards recovery. I wish you luck and stay strong. 💖"

And I've seen you give advice to other people on your own post telling them that it isn't worth it to commit suicide and don't be afraid to ask for help. Apply this to yourself. Ask for help and possibly even show them this so they know just how serious you are and aren't being ""over-dramatic"".

It seems like your family loves you and you love them. Take it day by day. Write yourself a letter pretending to be someone you love. Write to you all the things you think they love about you.

I’ve destroyed the first two, my family found my third one last November-even after I decided I couldn’t go through with it ( I couldn’t bring myself to leave my puppy behind because I knew she wouldn’t understand what happened). Since then, I’ve been in counseling and prescribed medications to help me as I work through my issues (abused, bullied, raped-when I was 13- and the abuse continued well into adulthood). I look back now and can barely remember the months leading up to the time I started seeing my counselor. It’s all some kind of dark fog. 

I know it doesn’t always seem to work for everyone, i have had two councilors before this one who were no good and mis-prescribed me drugs that made it worse. But then I got lucky. 

There are two things that helped me even make it to this far: 

One: I love creative writing, so whatever hardships or pain I experience, I give that to my characters. And that’s helped some. Someone told me it’s tranferance. Or something like that.

The second this is, when things are really bad and I can’t even find the strength to get up off the floor, I tell myself that it’s not going to lick me…”I’m going to live through it-I won’t think about it now, I’ll think about it tomorrow because tomorrow is another day.” Yes, I’m borrowing that from a movie, but it helps.

You can get sick leave from school because of this and just relax for a moment.
Its a lot like that for people at the start of depression, but you will get used to it and with meds and therapist its so much easier.

No shame in telling your problems to somebody and you have to remember that depression changes your thoughts and its making you think people hate you or you are a burden, but if people hated you they would let you know.

You are not even a teenager your brain alters in puberty so its possible that in a year or 2 your mental problems are gone or a lot better.
You are still growing so you have to eat.

If your brains dont get energy it will affect you mentally and your braincels start to die so pls eat.

I had very similar feelings and experiences when my depression started when i was a teenager, but several years later im in a lot better state mentally and so will you."

Singurul sfat pe care ti-l pot da e sa astepti, spune-ti ca, ba, daca va merge din rau in mai rau mai am timp sa iau decizia asta, dar esti mult prea tanara sa dai cu piciorul la un viitor posibil fericit, ofera-i macar o șansa. 

Știu ca-i stigma mare pe la noi cu mental health dar daca nu mergi deja ar fi foarte recomandat un psiholog sau psihiatru, chiar ajuta mult.

Most of them seemed like they had been losers in school themselves, and were trying to to make up for that not only by giving the ""popular kids"" free reign to torment anybody they deemed deserving, but by actually joining in on it.

Then I made the most wonderful friends in my new school. And it made me realise that no it wasn't OK to have my feelings dismissed and weaponised. I saw that there were people who liked me for me and who I didn't have to beg attention from. Life is so different when relationships feel secure. It changed the way I thought about myself and approached relationships. 

I'm not saying the same will go for you because I feel really lucky. But I just really want you to know that good people do not treat you this way and reading your replies made me feel sad that this is what you have. And although I met my friends by chance it was the way they acknowledged my pain and treated others that informed my decision to maintain such a relationship. 

I think that your environment has a significant impact on self image and mood, more than I anticipated. And it seems like your environment has been terrible to you. School kids can be so cruel and ignorant of the pain they cause.

It really doesn't matter what anyone thinks about you, people think bad things about everyone based on looks and personality or what they've heard, I've learned to think fuck everyone and anything they think. I'm a nice guy always but when it comes down to what people think about you, fuck em. Who gives a fuck, the thing that matters is if you are happy. You need to be happy and that's all. To be happy you need to be content with your physical self and confidence helps as well. Different is good, if everyone was the same, thought the same, liked the same stuff, looked the same, life would be so boring. People are just judgmental and like I said, fuck what they think. If anything, use it as motivation to make it in life and do better than everyone else, stop thinking bad about yourself. We are all just sacks of meat here.

You can control it, even to the point to forget you have it, but it's there. We enjoy the days that depression is weak and deal with the ones that it's strong.

It sounds hella depressing but accepting it helps. At least the pain of denial goes away and the frustration of having another episode is smaller. You also will be more prepared in case of depression getting in the way again.

You're doing good, friend. Listen to your songs, eat your food, do your things. Small things matter. It doesn't seems like it, but all your efforts are making a difference, they're stopping depression from swallowing you up entirely."

thank you for this.

you explained it perfectly. i get so frustrated because i am trying to do everything right to “cure” it and push it aside, but if it comes, it comes. you can be doing everything right but still have the days when it’s the strongest and everything feels impossible. i tend to feel like a failure when it does knock me down like this. i will start to think “what’s the point of even trying then”. looking at it in your perspective really helps though.

you made me realize that i’ve never really accepted the fact that depression is something i will have to manage for the rest of my life. accepting that is hard, but i think looking at it this way will help the hard days be a little less frustrating and i can give myself more grace.

kvvv8ji,b0dyandsoul,1,,1711027427,depression," I think you are depressed my friend and depression wants you to feel alone helpless like everything is pointlessz start going for walks start figuring out what kind of person you want to be.

Try different things have that talk with your parents about how you feel. 

Try to be more social engage more there is no salvation on your smart phone. 

We are more than mindless consumers, and if you feel like none of those things help or you can't take those steps see a doctor, counseling or psychologist maybe you need a hand in getting you back to baseline. 

I understand too I promise things do get better but you have to do the opposite of what your brain body is telling you. 

Put the devices away force yourself, just try you are worthy of it. You are worthy of a good life.

You are young and inexperienced in terms of life, the longer you go on the better things will get if you try. Don’t worry about relationships too much, you will find one when you are meant to find one. Also, don’t try to be like anyone but yourself it is a fools game to try and change yourself, rather you should accept yourself. I am very sorry about your mother. You should try to talk to your Grandmother, as much as you do not want to make her sad i’m sure she’d rather listen too your problems than have you dead. There is nothing cowardly about not wanting to die. In truth, a person never wants to die, they just wish their lives could be different.

I thought the world had nothing more to offer me and that I would never live a happy life, but I had no idea, I couldn't even begin to fathom everything that life could be. Yes, there will be horrible moments that you can never recover from, such as losing your mother, but there will also be moments that are beyond beautiful. You will meet new friends and laugh so hard with them that your stomach hurts, but in a good way, you will fall in love with someone and you're going to feel like you are floating on clouds. You will watch a movie that feels like home to you. You will find something that you love doing, and it will become your passion. You will hear a song that feels like the artist is talking about your life. You will be impressed when you reach a goal you never thought you could. 

You are sixteen, and for some of us, our teen years  will be so challenging, and yes, you would feel like giving up, but it's not worth it. You have an entire life ahead of you. Please, I beg of you, survive the darkness so that you will be able to witness the light."

At 16 you've only just scratched the surface of what life has to offer; there's a whole vast world waiting to open up to you after high school, teeming with people who will accept you for who you are. 

Also, pills are not a painless way to go, and you'll probably just end up aching in a hospital bed with a pumped stomach and people worried sick about you.

kvt4xw4,Professional_Sky_212,7,,1710976138,depression," Hi sweety. Please don't do this. I know school is difficult but there is a life after school. I promise. School is just socially concentrated on fads. The adult world doesnt work like this. Everyone's different. And what's great about it is nobody cares. Nobody cares if I'm skinny or overweight, tall or short. People just go about their day because they have their own adulting lives to take care of (work, kids, grocery shopping, etc..) I'm 40. Do you know how many people from my high school I've seen since I graduated? None. I live in the same city as the school I graduated. The world is a big place and you will find your kindred spirits that accept you just as you are. I'm sure there's a girl you don't notice that thinks you're cute and you'll never know. That's what happened to me with a boy. I found out 20 years later when I saw him and told me he had a crush on me back then. He was a quiet guy in the corner of the class that never spoke to me. 


I'm sorry about your mom. You need to grieve for as long as you need to. You might grieve for all your life and that's okay. She was your mom and you miss her. There's nothing wrong with that. If your grieving is too hard to deal with, maybe talk to a therapist, letting it out and talking about it helps a lot. Or maybe a diary to unload your thoughts in? That helps me a lot. It's like saving your brain thoughts in a diary instead of keeping it in your head all day. 


Can you please wait until you graduate school and be an adult to see what life has in store for you? You might be surprised amd have a great happy life! You still havent gone to college yet. College is completely different from high school! I thought college was super fun because I was in classes with people like ME. I studied 3D animation. I was with artists just like me. High school is mixed with jocks, nerds, geeks, metalheads, everything. College they put you in a class with people with minds just like you, that are passionate about the subject of study, just like you. Lots more in comon! It was amazing! 


Can you please hold up for a while and taste more of life? There's so much more you havent experienced yet! At best, for a solution for the present time, maybe try another school? You might fit better at another school. You never know!!!!


Take care ok????"

I can guarantee you that whatever pills you have access to will likely not be painless or quick. It’s okay that you’re not the tallest or most athletic person. It’s okay that you don’t fit the stereotype of what a black man is perceived as. 

I’m sorry for the loss of your mother at such a young age. Please know that it okay for you to still grieve over her passing. I wish there was more I can do, but I do empathize with you as a black woman who struggled to find my footing as a teenager transitioning into adulthood. Wishing you the best."

High School is a hotbed for projecting insecurity and making people feel like they're the minority. If you attend college, you will find like-minded people who share similar interests and be able to bond with them. If you decide to work right away, the bullying and harassment that you're currently facing will become essentially nonexistent depending on the situation. You are incredibly young and have so much life ahead of you. I didn't even have my first girlfriend until I was 17, so trust the process and tough it out. Teenagers are difficult to deal with, especially at an age when your confidence is barely starting to develop. You're doing good so far man, just keep staying away from those negative influences, and keep your head in the books. You will make it far. Just because you feel like a relationship is unobtainable to you right now, doesn't mean it won't change in the future. Also you should try to convey some of your concerns with your grandma, even if it's' a teeny tiny bit."

I didn’t have a relationship until I turned 24, and holy shit was it worth the wait. Just remember, you don’t know what the future holds for you. Sometimes it’s good to hold out on those dark temptations and see what life may have in store! Life is hard. Find something you love to do and let it consume you. Patience is tough but worth it"
kvtfp8a,nathallium,2,,1710980116,depression," Dude, happiness and a great life doesn’t come from being in a romantic relationship. Your entire life’s happiness won’t come from from finding a girl that loves you. That’s just part of life and not one that’s worth ending your life over. 

Real Love is forgetting yourself and looking out for another; real love is sacrificing your wants and desires to do what someone else wants. Think about your grandma and what would you be willing to do to make her happy.

People have to be happy already if they are going to have a happy romantic relationship, and  people have to find their purpose in life because a romantic relationship is not a life purpose. You can do great things for the world around you, but you still need more education and discovery and maturity, so it’s ok if you don’t know what use you have in the world yet.

Look at what everyone here says—they know that there’s so much more to life, so don’t ever listen to the wild thoughts/ideas that come from those sad and lonely feelings.

And as a black guy (as a quiet black guy who also doesn’t sag my pants and who talks proper and doesn’t curse and who doesn’t play basketball), you don’t need to try to fit the culture of those around you. The world is a big place, and after you leave high school you can find your place and your people in it. Don’t let those black teenagers be your role model.

Keep living, you have much to live for."

I can’t even wait for you to experience life outside of the current bubble society you are in.  Also- grief over the loss of a loved one is a lifelong thing.  Your sadness reflects the love, don’t feel like you “should” be over it- there is no such thing.

kvtfnmu,Cmprssdsugarpellet,1,,1710980100,depression," I would take the time to consider what happens when suicide isn’t successful— you could end up severely injuring yourself and having to live with that on top of how you feel now. 

High school feels like forever because it’s now. In 5 years, none of this will matter to you. 16 is close to graduating (few more years), which opens your opportunities to go out and meet new people and find your voice. Usually the kids who pick on others are in reality the most insecure of the bunch, and deflect by lashing out at others they admire or are envious of. I’m sure you have great qualities about yourself that don’t need comparison to others. 

As for your mom— there is no time limit on grief. One day you may feel less upset, that doesn’t mean the sadness is gone; just that you can cope with it better. I’m sorry for your loss and hope you can let go of the idea that you need to “get over it”."

Look, I felt the same way at your age, also at 20, and 21... I'm 38 now. I have dated a few women, been dating for several years and have had hook ups too though now I'm single. I've never been women's type. Be patient, you are too young to think there's anything wrong with you and relationships yet, not to mention your generation seems particularly f*cked up when it comes to relationships so be extra patient.

You are not a bitch or a coward, you have common sense, enough of it to not want to get into silly fights or silly arguments, that's ok, just because everyone else around is a human disaster doesn't mean you have to become another one.

All you are feeling is very normal at your age but it will get a lot better once you understand better the world you live in. Don't get me wrong, you will realize the world kinda sucks...but you will understand better why and might know what to do to improve your life then. It's too early now, it's 100% legit to feel that way but that will change.

I know a psych ward stay or something similar sounds like hell, but I'm a success story.  My last psych hospital stay was about a year long.  That length is not the norm, of course, but they hooked me up with so many resources before discharging me.  They were extremely thorough and it taught me patience in a way I could never learn otherwise.  I still feel my depression and anxiety, but I have a bunch of people (professionals) helping me now.

Even a short 72 hour stay can be incredibly helpful.  They are never going to discharge you without, at least, a psychiatrist and therapist to meet with pretty soon after you leave.  Please, don't do what I did for years and cancel these appointments.  I can't do that now because they come to my house 3x a week.

Please don't be afraid to ask for what you need, OP.  Even if you don't know quite exactly what you need.  And remember, healing takes time, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it."

all you need to do at that age is school and to work on yourself mentally and physically. if you want, try to become confident, outgoing or even funny thats what helped me the most. once i got out of my early HS depression and my anxiety dropped i could talk anyone girl or guy. im not condoning it but weed was a miracle for me at that time, not anymore though."
kvu20hw,Stonedcoldbabe,1,,1710988828,depression," There's soooo much more to life! 

You are only 16 years old and this will not be the end of your life. I understand what you mean by ""white-washed"". Being too ""white"" for the black kids and too ""black"" for the white kids, sometimes you feel like there's nowhere that you belong, but there IS. This is something that I have dealt with my whole life as an African American woman. Keep being your authentic self and you will find YOUR people. It will not happen overnight (it honestly could though) but trust the process of life.  Even though you may not see it now, you will succeed above the people that you feel are succeeding above you now. Bullies will never be doing better than you 10 years from now, they're not even doing better than you now. I know from my own experience and other's as well.

You walk away and laugh because you are young and you are still learning life and processing different experiences, personalities, and different backgrounds of people, while all still figuring your own self out. It is okay to not know how to respond. This is why you keep living and learning. You will eventually have the skills to respond appropriately to these situations. 

Your life will be impactful.

Yeah, it’s not a perfect response. I’ve never felt strong enough to take control and make changes though - but eventually I realized that was cause of the situation I was in during high school. You’re not a bitch or a coward, but you’re not going to internalize that until you’re not in a situation where you’re having people tell you that shit every day.

If it takes playing more video games than you should until then, whatever man. That’s life. Life is suffering, sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get through"
kvun5yg,Grunenteufel,1,,1710999959,depression," I care too, man. Lots of people feel this way in high school and it will definitely pass. Learn to embrace your true self now so that you're ready to give 'em all you got in college and beyond. I've come to learn that it doesn't really matter what you're all about; but that you're confident in your own skin and passionate about whatever it is you're interested in. You'll find your people. 

I know it's hard to do in the face of all this anguish but focus on your studies, get good grades to get into a good school, (community college even to save money and transfer) stay disciplined and nobody can deny you. The girls that want a real relationship, not frivolous hook-ups and shallow connections, respect dedication and proper talking - not pant sagging and disrespect. A couple push-ups here and there never hurt anyone's chances either. Things will get better"

Set goals for each day to hold yourself accountable. And fake the confidence till you make it. Also look forward to after high school where most people who werent popular in high school, kind of restart and build a new image. You got this bro"
kvv0b3b,candiedbug,1,,1711009755,depression," I remember the absolute hell... and I mean hell, not exaggerating, being 16 was for me. Abusive father, mother terrified of him, I was severely bullied in school, even from some of the teachers. It honestly felt like there was no end to it, I truly believed dying was my only recourse. Somehow I endured (a lot of thanks I owe to an elderly librarian at my high school that let me hide in the school's library so I didn't have to go home until late). I got through college, and the experience was the complete opposite of high school. I was so incredibly glad I didn't kill myself because I honestly had no idea what I was going to miss. 

My advice: hang on, ask for help from anywhere, it'll be scary (trust me I know) but don't give up... it WILL get so much better after you leave high school. Give it a chance, you are worth it so much."
kvv5zmv,Ant1m1nd,1,,1711014063,depression," Please don't do it! Life is rough as a teenager. You're still growing, your hormones are all out of whack. And to be frank, teenagers are bloody cruel. To some people their teenage years end up being the very best time of their lives. To others, they're the absolute worst. I promise you that everything that seems so end of the world right now *will* get better. Teens tend to focus on the superficial bullshit. Right now your problem isn't you. It's the people around you. From what you're describing they don't sound like very nice people. You deserve better.   


You don't have to tell your grandmother you're suicidal. But you should try talking to her a bit. Or even just ask for a hug. Tell her you're having a hard time at school because you're more mature than your peers. And that they aren't very nice to you.   


I'll tell you a little about myself because I think it may help you. When I was 14, I tried to kill myself. My boyfriend cheated on me and it felt like the end of the world. I felt like garbage. Like there was nobody else out there for me. That it was my fault. That I was worthless. That the world would be better without me. My younger brother caught me. He talked to me and gave me a hug. It changed everything. I'm 43 years old now and have been married for 18 years. I met my husband when I'd hit the point in my life where I gave up on relationships entirely. I decided to focus on me, and doing things I enjoy. My life isn't perfect. But it is much better than it was all of those years ago."

A few months ago I started looking around my community for volunteer opportunities. My depression is lifted. My life is busy and full. I'm surrounded by other people who are working to make our community a better place. 

You have real struggles. Life as a teenager can be brutal. Losing your mom is something I can't even comprehend. If you have the money or insurance, please look into getting some mental health treatment. Medication can often help, at least in the short term. If you don't have access to outside care, talk to your school guidance counselor. That's probably a good idea regardless as they will have familiarity with the social dynamics that are causing you pain. 

Lastly. No matter what. You are valuable. You are loved and you are deserving of love. Please cut yourself some slack. Discover the person you want to be. Don't ever beat yourself up for not being who you think others want."

As time goes on, how you feel, your reality, how you view the world and people, your relationships with others etc, that will all change.

Your brain hasn’t fully developed yet, our brains typically take about 25 years until they’re fully developed, so as it grows your perception and understanding of the world will shift a bit.

kvvlm1o,earlgreyteahc,3,,1711023247,depression," don’t make this your personality. romance isn’t everything. you don’t want wanting a girlfriend to be your personality. it’ll only make it harder and make girls stay away from you. learn to appreciate yourself first and someone will come to you. get some therapy. get into stuff/hobbies that involve more people. do it for you and not for the purpose of finding someone and they’ll find you. someone in the comments said if you aren’t happy single a relationship won’t make it any better. this is true. being depressed in a relationship sucks. it’s hard on partners. being in a relationship there is always a possibility for a break up,  you atleast wanna not hate yourself before a break up because after all you wanna do is blame yourself and think about what you could have done differently. love yourself now."
kvtlgmn,poetryofworms,4,,1710982285,depression," Work on yourself. It seems like your self esteem is really low. That’s not meant to be an insult by the way. I struggle with self esteem also. But in order to not only attract but have the confidence to keep, you have to do real deep work on yourself. Improve everything you can about yourself within your power. This will not only help you attract women but friends as well. But it has to be genuine self improvement. You can’t fake it."

And I can say from experience, if you focus on your physical, mental, and spiritual health in the meantime, you will be that other guy that she finds that is the better option. I know it sounds sad to say ""focus on yourself"", but you seriously have the power to make yourself more desirable. It's not a bad thing.

Eventually I got sick of trying for anything serious and realized it’s not the only thing to life. I’ve also always been bad with women, it’s surprising I was able to have any experience.

I now strive to make myself happy by excelling in life. Just being healthy, making money, and figuring out how to love myself. The money, pride, and hard work is what keeps me alive now. Just a thought man, that love shit isn’t what it’s put out to be. I could never find it and I never met anyone who had anything that truly lasts.

I havn’t talked to a women or done anything close to intimate in over 8 months. Happier than I was when I was actively trying and overthinking constantly. A huge weight off my back to be honest.

Good luck friend."
kvu72s1,Classic-Usual-3941,0,,1710991052,depression," I get it. 34M and still single.

Dating isn't easy. I've been through hell in a handbasket to find someone. The problem is, the women I've met are all quick to assume. I've been called a creep, a thirsty person, accused of wanting to fuck them, pick them up, etc. Every negative comment or connotation in the book, I've gotten it up the ass.

I've never laid a hand on a woman in my life, and I don't intend to. I'm too proud, and I'm too much of a real man to want to hurt them like that. But I'm paying for the legit creeps.

Couple that with the fact that I like them younger (early 20s women). Chaos ensues.

I'm this far from giving up and declaring that it just isn't worth it for me. I'm a proud aspiring opera singer, and I should focus on that. At least it makes me incredibly happy and feel confident as hell."

kvuk1nu,TheGamerWhosOnReddit,2,,1710997910,depression," That's fine. Some teenage romances end in teenage pregnancy and trust me when I say you do not want to live with the stresses that come with that.  


Besides at 14 you have a lot of self-growth to work on, not just in terms of bettering yourself, but actually developing an identity.  


Who knows, maybe some day you'll look back on today and laugh because you'll have found someone or grown past the point of thinking that love is everything, because it really isn't.  


Relationships don't make people happy, people that are happy form relationships.  


Keep your head up."

I find that i have trouble opening up, and I’m an avoider. So as for the therapy, that’s something for you to figure out, and all i can really say is to try and be honest and get things over with. If you have something you want to deal with/talk about, try to just bring it up. Try to deal with it head on. 

Generally just remember that things will change. I know it sounds cheesy or basic, but it’s true, and reminding yourself that things change can be helpful. Your life won’t be the same in the future. Circumstances change, and you can also change, and learn to deal/cope with things. You can make changes in your life. And even with bad things in life, life is worth living.

When I was in high school even the shy nerdy guys started to smoke and go out and get drunk just to be accepted by the rest of the class. I refused to do any of that so literally I only had 2 friends outside of school and had to stop seeing them too because they started to smoke weed. In europe weed is extremely illegal and I didn't want them to peer pressure me into trying it. From age 20 till now I had no social contact with anyone my age
kvzpi8m,Icy-Conflict9217,0,,1711075943,depression, I know where you’re coming from. But why can’t you just tell them you don’t smoke and still hang out with them? I have friends who do that all the time.
kvzpwr0,darkheartsuicidepact,1,,1711076115,depression, The same reason a gay person can't hang out with a bunch of homophobes. I ain't about to be there just to get insulted and made fun of and be someones punching bag. I'll rather be alone
kvzq4h8,darkheartsuicidepact,1,,1711076208,depression," What are they gonna talk about anyways? Football/soccer, I hate sports. Sex, details about their last one night stand, I don't wanna listen to that shit. I didn't have sex for years."

Have you considered trying any sports or hobbies and making friends there? Plus, some hobbies tend to consist of people with really healthy lifestyles who most likely don’t smoke"
kvzqbhs,darkheartsuicidepact,1,,1711076292,depression, Don't care? They will literally call you a pussy and a loser for not smoking and for not having sex. Why do you act like you never been though high school before or just life in general!
kvzqkpx,Icy-Conflict9217,0,,1711076404,depression," I have, that’s just not my experience. Sure, maybe you’ll get teased from time to time but that’s completely normal. Everyone teases each other about different shit. Why don’t you just try to make friends with people who share common interests with you? Or maybe just be more open to people who have completely different interests"
kvy3lju,spoodernoodles,1,,1711054468,depression," You... can't fake depression.

You also can't rule out depression just because it's ""not severe enough"". It might help to view depression on a scale rather than as something you have or don't have. There's varying degrees of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and symptoms vary from person to person...  Just because you don't have the urge to waste your life away in bed doesn't mean you don't have depression. Hell, you already mentioned dealing with emptiness and having suicidal thoughts.

Could you imagine a doctor saying, ""You've got some suicidal ideations, but since you don't have the urge to rot in bed I can't diagnose you for depression""? That'd be a POS analysis, wouldn't it?"

kvux4gm,Bubbly-Stand-1212,1,,1711007288,depression," Young person, read carefully. 

I have several severe mental issues along with the really bad side of ADHD. I personally believe everyone hates me no matter how great the conversation plays out. I spend everyday trying to pull myself up. So I will tell you a story and I want you to digest this, internalize and rationalize your thoughts. Like I have to do every day, this is key. 
 
I have attempted suicide 2 times. All at my lowest point of my depression all stemming from my ADHD -the bad side of having it and growing up without actual care- I became addicted to pills and over dosed twice. I too thought I wasn’t smart, that no body liked me as a person and especially getting the same flack at home from my parents that my RSD(rejection sensitivity disorder) would tell me. It’s almost like a voice in my head  but it actually hurts. I was diagnosed late in life because of the US didn’t take mental health seriously. So it went untreated leading to me believing I was the worst thing in existence. What we are doing here, what you are doing in this post is healthy, talking about it really helps and honesty is actually an incredible feeling. Like I said rationalize your thoughts, this is how I get through my RSD sending me spiraling. If I think someone hates me I tell them about RSD and most of the time people have never heard of it but always express some validation I needed to rationalize. By no means am I equating my disorder to what you’re going through, I can only imagine because of where I was. 

I am now in my mid 30s and over the last year I have hit rock bottom again after being injured at work. I will have great difficulty walking for the rest of my life, my work abandoned me and so did workers comp. I will lose everything by the end of the month. I’ve lost my insurance and my medications. Currently,  I am spiraling and like you I am terrified of getting older. Trying to talk you off a ledge has set me at ease. Genuinely, thank you for helping me off my ledge but right now you’re important. 

Take a look around your immediate area. Is your area clean? What I’m suggesting is make your space something you can have pride in for you. Create your safe space, fill it with love for you. Whatever it is that makes you feel good and can retreat to. Please also talk to yourself out loud, hear your own voice so you can actually hear what you’re thinking of doing, talk to friends that support you and just tell them the truth. Then think about your path, you’re scared of getting older. Like I was and still am, what’s scaring you and how do you talk about it so you understand what you can do to steer away from the fears and look at it as something beautiful. If you’re surrounded by toxicity, people who don’t understand you or even if you haven’t given them the respect to know what you’re going through. Identifying the issues and creating the solutions, unfortunately fall on us. This can make you feel trapped, especially if you have no support or won’t accept support. The world is yours, it’s just run by unimportant people. 

I really hope you find something and continue to grow. 
When I took those pills and started drifting out, I could hear my parents fighting for me. They found me in my room on the floor leaving. It is my biggest regret having almost put them through that, not once but twice and on purpose. All because I couldn’t speak, you have a voice and you are beautiful. Man or woman, the only ugly people are the ones that only take from others and deny people the decency to just live. Have integrity for yourself and find your way. Maybe you will stay up from spiraling and come across someone who has been where you are and you can try save them from that pit. 

I promise you, it’s worth it to at least continue to try. I’m saying this even though I am currently about to be homeless. Instead of trying to figure out what the hell I’m going to do, I am trying to help you. So please, learn who you are, who you want to be. Not societies views of what you should be. Who YOU want to be and make it happen. If you say dead then I might as well relapse right now because you’re far better off than I am. You have time to read EVERYTHING and practice things to make yourself the best you can. I’ll tell you something my dad used to say to me that I thought was the stupidest shit growing up. I learned what that lesson meant by the time I was 30. I won’t tell you, you need to think about it. 

“I can show you the water, but I can’t make you drink it.” 

I mean that, your post walked me off my ledge. I want you to find out what the water means to you. Remember to have integrity, always show love no matter how hard it is and talk, out loud or to someone. If someone doesn’t understand you, educate them on how you feel. No body is going to understand you if you don’t let them in. Don’t follow others. Trust yourself and you will be surrounded by what will make you happy, it always finds us. Learn who you are, not what you think you are."
kvul2w0,Honest-Charity-946,0,,1710998580,depression, Cmon dude you are just 14 there is so much to life. I felt the same way when I was 14 and let me tell you I never regret the decision of not ending myself. I started to spend more time with my family and friends and I was good to go. Mind you I never had good friends or even a girlfriend ( I still don’t I am 18 now ) but life moves on killing yourself isn’t the solution. I will admit I am still not fully cured I still have depression but I have started working out lately and let me tell you that build up a lot of confidence in you and improves your mental health. Just ignore everything and just focus on what you love and I promise you you will be happy then. Just talk to your family friends and do what you love do what makes you happy and you will be happier than ever before. This is the mentality I have been going on with the past 4 yrs and let me tell you it works 😉.

I still have scars up and down my back.  

Get video proof, take it to an adult, hell Im sure any other adult than the teachers or those at the school would understand! they can get involved and help, please keep your head up try to carry yourself with grace, its the best weapon socially. 

 You are so strong and brave."
kvtf3zk,KaleidoscopeShot1869,3,,1710979895,depression," First of all, I am so sorry that this is happening to you. You do not deserve this, and it is not your fault. Those people are fucking assholes.

And I'm so sorry that a teacher, who is supposed to support you in this situation, is falling short and letting this behavior happen.

Bullying is no joke and you have every right to feel upset about this.

I'm not exactly sure what to do in this situation given I don't know the full context. But if you can, raise it to higher ups, whether it's another teacher, counselor principal, dean or whatever. I would also recommend if you have a support system such as your parents (depending on how they are), and maybe your one friend who also witnessed this behavior. If there's a teacher you trust or seems like they would care, you could maybe try to bring it up to them and ask for help. If the other students are pushing you around and getting physical that is already assault and then in addition to them saying things I can't even imagine what you're going through. They should have consequences for their behavior. 

But again, please know, you do not deserve any of this, and you have done nothing wrong. From my experience, there are horrible people out there in the world that like to treat others like shit if they seem ""different"". Even though there is nothing wrong with being different. Idk if it stems from their own feelings of incompetence or just other things but there is no excuse for what they are doing to you.

I'm not sure exactly how helpful any of this would be. But I do encourage you to try and find a support system to get help because you shouldn't have to go through this alone. And know you are valid in asking for that help, and any one who dismisses your concerns like that teacher, are in the wrong. 

I'm also not sure if this is advisable, but it might be helpful to have evidence of the other people's behavior such as on a camera if you have a phone to back yourself up. 

Either way, I know some people who have had to change schools because of bullying like this because nothing has been done and I really hope that wouldn't have to happen for you, but know there are options. Good luck <3"
kvuwfkw,bethanychanel,2,,1711006752,depression," Tell your parents, tell your teacher, make a problem out of it, because it is one. Kids can be cruel, but in your age, there’s no shame in seeking help from an adult. 

I’m so sorry your teacher reacted in that way, but you cannot let those people mess with you like that. Good luck ❤️"
kvv3xbr,12acuratl207,2,,1711012543,depression," Hey kiddo, I was bullied hard in school too. It's very hard and when you're young or even as an adult it can feel like your life isn't worth much or something's wrong with you. Well there's nothing wrong with you it's them. I'm 39 now, I'm a supervisor at a hospital and the bullies? I still see them but usually in the psych rooms drooling or coming off of drugs. So chin up! Cause you're going to be the winner. Record the bullies, report to school, parents and police. Take boxing or jitsu. Or just watch YouTube videos and practice. Don't let anyone disturb your peace. You are worthy of respect and love. Say it, mean it, believe it. You are worthy of respect and love. We are all equal, no one can bring you down."

Don’t over exhaust yourself either, go slowly but time your breaks to avoid fall backs. Perhaps seeing a doctor or antidepressants might help. Set yourself limits and goals. Reward them with a cold shower or more time for yourself but not sleeping. Best of luck."

It’s like no one is awake and it’s quite so it’s you and your mind together but I feel fine through the day and night but randomly I get these waves of emotions and  emptyness mostly at night tho and It feels like it’s a endless cycle
kvu6rjm,Waffles_four_you,1,,1710990910,depression," Other people’s problems don’t make yours silly. People are depressed and anxious for all sorts of reasons and we can’t control it otherwise we would just stop being depressed. You can’t control when you’re having a panic attack and anxiety makes it hard to respond to things rationally so you can’t control that either so even if you are overreacting it’s not as if you’re consciously choosing to do so or faking it all. Your problems are valid and you shouldn’t feel as if you need to bottle them up. If you want to vent I’m perfectly fine for you to do so but you can also write these feelings down for yourself just to see what things you’re going through and to realise that it is a lot. Being numb is also a symptom of depression but I’m no professional so I can’t diagnose you but just know that I know how that feels along with many others in this sub and it is tough to deal with, especially when you’re doubting whether or not you even have a reason to feel the way that you do.

Although my surroundings are entirely different. I have a partner for 10 years, I live on my own since 7, I have two jobs that I like to endure and quite good friends and Hobbys. But nothing of that is relevant when you can't enjoy life.
I always thought time will come when living life starts, especially because I spent the past 4 years of focusing on self improvement, and I felt like I had huge success.
Came to understand some roots of my issues, explored my ADHD to a extend I never did, managed to speak to people without anxiety etc.

Overall I got better, I can say that, but on the other hand my lows got lower, and I am not sure anymore if live is worth living. 

Edit: I fear that this will lead to a future where I'm one of the lost causes that walk this planet, that one can only pity. I met a lot of good souls that got lost in live and became a shadow of themselves. 
That's why I am gonna try therapy once more, currently that's my last hope.

In the moment the feeling sucks cause it almost feels like it’s your fault, but it’s not. Relationships are already fickle enough, looking to more stable things that we have control over will help maintain our happiness. The right relationship will come to you when it’s ready!

kvqxm8r,IlluminateMatrixStar,1,,1710949739,depression," This is belief dependent, with the acceptance that the unknown holds a very real possibility of reincarnation as well as other possible outcomes we simply cannot know. 

The concept of reincarnation holds the idea that the essence of our being transitions with us into a new existence. If one views life through this lens, it suggests that the state of mind with which one departs this life is the seed of the new mind for the beginning of the next. Energy is not destroyed or created, only transferred or transformed. Death is like a moment in time here, but more like a strong groove carved in the sand. Each mind from the previous moment we carry to the next moment unless we create some fundamental change and repeat that change until it becomes an unconscious automatic habit. Being happy despite circumstance is not easy, it is a conscious choice to choose to generate certain thoughts and feelings. This is the challenge that depression teaches us and perhaps we have to repeat countless lifetimes until we evolve. Or perhaps not. No one knows. 

IT IS EASY ENOUGH to be pleasant,
When life flows by like a song,
But the man worth while is one who will smile, When everything goes dead wrong.
For the test of the heart is trouble,
And it always comes with the years,
And the smile that is worth the praises of earth Is the smile that shines through tears.

Therefore, a life concluded in the depths of sadness and despair by suicide or natural means could potentially influence the starting point of the soul's next journey. 

If you work in hospice you notice most people that die naturally die in peace. They accept their fate. They completed their mission on earth and learned what they came here to learn and died when it was their time. There is a deep peace and acceptance. Therefore we can assume there will be a string of evolution for their next mind/incarnation. 

If someone is able to commit suicide with true peace and acceptance that would be a much better insurance plan for them. But by ending life early, they are trying to avoid their dhamma karma, by starting over. But the only way is through. Like Luke Skywalker through the cave. I personally don’t believe suicide solves anything. It merely delays the inevitable facing of something we must. Until we learn to transform it but going through it to its conclusion."

You might be surprised on how good life can be . To be able to outlive your enemies.

There is actually no certainty I can give to you on why you should live. Who knows future, maybe things will get worse. Who knows what is after death, maybe won't be better than this.

The only thing you know, is that you're alive right now... You're thinking. You're aware, a mind within a body.

I find a lot of confort in thinking life is for learning. Because is the only thing you can control. You can't control things coming at you, instead you can control how to react to them, how to interpret them, how to accept them.

And that is a fact. Whatever you can't handle will kill you. Why not use this as an opportunity? Consider yourself dead and live without the fear of judgement from anyone, without societal implications. What you are going through is so very hard. And you have done it for a long time. Trust me that made you strong as fuck without you even realizing it. We need people with that kind of strength. There is something in this suffering you can tap into. Idk what but I'm sure you can find it. Trust me you are unbelievable strong, you just don't seen it.Some of the best advice I got for why I shouldn't kill myself today?  Because you can always do it tomorrow. And then tomorrow ask yourself again. My greatest sadness comes when I ask myself what the future will hold, then I worry I won't be able to handle it. But this moment? We can always handle this moment. As humans this is what we were built to handle. I believe in you my friend, we need you in this world."

I have been to school for like 4 hours these past 2 weeks like you said the online things to do. That’s what I’m starting to do I physically cannot be in school I freak out and think everyone is judging and making fun of me. I haven’t seen a therapist And gotten medication because I have a “fear” of medicine (it’s childish I know) but it just makes me scared for side affects and stuff. I can really really relate to rotting in bed I’ve ranted about this in other posts but it’s my biggest issue, my hair is tangled, I barely get up to use the bathroom , I can’t sleep and my hygiene is in shambles. Only difference between me and you is that I’ve never had good grades or nothing I’ve just been a bed rotting 15 year old kid this whole time with nothing to look forward to. But never mind me I think u should just talk to someone about how u feel and express the problems. My advice is just hang on in there these thoughts and feelings will pass (hopefully). If u need to talk I’ll be here all day and night."
kvutner,Ill_Beach_2895,1,,1711004637,depression," i’m so glad to find someone who could relate, you’ve no idea. school is so utterly draining, and when depression and extreme (social) anxiety is added to the mix… horrible outcomes. 

and your fear of medicine isn’t childish, it’s very very common :) it’s hard for me to take it because it takes away the thoughts and feelings i’ve known for so long and it makes me feel “better” but then i feel so different and even worse because if my depressive thoughts and feelings decrease.. i have no excuse to be so “lazy” and then i feel worse and don’t take them and yeah :// (don’t get me wrong, they do help, it just takes effort to get used to them. i don’t mean to scare you away from them, they do help me :))

but please don’t agonize over your grades,, they don’t determine your worth at all. my family always prioritized grades and education over everything so i did the same.. look where i ended up lol

but i really relate to you too, with like everything you’ve said, and it’s actually make me feel better that i’m not alone. thank you :)) and i’m here for you too.  💗"

It seems you’ve missed more school days than I have, has your parents got in trouble or anything does the school trip about it cause I haven’t been in a LONG time."
kvuur7s,Ill_Beach_2895,2,,1711005475,depression," i hope all goes well with you starting to take meds. they really do help, i just seemed so dramatic in my last reply because it’s quite a change you know to have your negative thoughts and feelings be lessened. if it makes you feel better, i really haven’t noticed any side effects. my appetite has come back full force lol so i’m eating more, which is good because i wasn’t eating at all before. i’m less depressed but still very anxious all the time but maybe the meds will help with that too eventually. 

about the school.. for me the school wasn’t concerned with my horrible attendance, but with my grades lol. teachers were giving me extensions and were trying so hard to get me to finish the work before the end of the quarter.. but i just couldn’t. i didn’t get into trouble, neither did my parents. the guidance counselor might speak with you and/or your parents, that happened to me. or maybe you/your parents could make the first move and speak to them. don’t worry about getting into trouble. the school should be there to help you, not punish you. i was very lucky to have a very supportive and understanding guidance counselor and teachers. i hope the same for you. 

and yeah.. we really are similar aren’t we lol"
kvuvb23,No_Incident1749,2,,1711005888,depression," So similar its crazy but thanks for the words once I get it ima man up and take the medicine hopefully these pills help with all my anxiety to, and makes me a calmer person my school is a hit and miss there cool sometimes and sometimes not but I’ve gotten in like a program TCISD or something weird like that because I have some physical issues but I will for sure ask my parents about it because I know its bad and the state of Texas only lets u miss like 7 days before u gotta do some programs and I’m already well past that lol but thanks for talking to me it made me feel better about everything and knowing there’s something out there like me and if u don’t mind when I get one of my little “episodes” can I reach out because it really is absolutely insane how similar the problem is 😭."
kvuvu5i,Ill_Beach_2895,1,,1711006302,depression," you can 100% reach out!! it’s always helpful to have someone to talk to, especially when you can relate so much. if you feel comfortable.. try to reach out to your school? or maybe your parents could? i had never gone to a guidance counselor before my issue but she really did help. she tried really hard to help me get back to school lol, even offered to do schoolwork in her office, but my anxiety couldn’t handle that so now we’re thinking of online school. best of luck to you!!! wishing the best!!!"

kvqnawy,dorkydue,1,,1710946264,depression," Yeah dude, I 100% understand how you feel. Motivation is pretty hard to come by and to be honest I really still don't understand the concept of being motivated. I'd just start small by maybe doing things you already enjoy, spending more time with the people you love, etc. Maybe set some little goals as well and build up? Could be as small as just like drinking more water, or taking small walks. It keeps you a little more occupied and can also give you a sense of purpose. As long as you're somewhat satisfied with anything you did that day, that's enough in my books. Like I said I'm also struggling to understand how to become motivated and LIVE, but that's how I'd start. Things take time though so it's okay if you don't feel better immediately, you know?

But take it from someone who has depression and had the teenage flu: I am so happy that the teenage years are over. Looking back I was way over dramatic and everything felt detrimental. My feelings were all over the place with me not having any way to manage them at all. It was scary and intense, but it was also important. When I got through my teenage years and early twenties, it was smooth sailing from there. I feel like the turmoil of teenage flu made me so much more happy and resistant now."

I can only help that things get better for me (especially since many of these feelings are because of chronic pain) so that usually gives me reason to carry on.

kvqdd1u,Hot_Inevitable5645,2,,1710942734,depression," Tbh, I can't say I know what it is either. I've always been an overachiever and gotten good grades. Ever since I've gotten in highschool, I've seemed to lose all motivation. I'm just not happy any more. I faced mild bullying in middle school which I still think about to this day but I don't think it affects me tht badly. My older brother committed suicide last November and I didn't know what to do with that piece of information. I didn't know how to grieve and to cope but I don't think that's it either. My grades have dropped significantly and teachers can tell I'm not the student I used to be. I'm very much aware of how bad it's gotten and past me would have never let it get this bad. I want to fix it but I have no motivation wht so ever. I'm also unsure of what my identity is. Not in the LGBTQ+ kind of way but I just don't know who I am and what I stand for. One day at school I was feeling so overwhelmed and empty and needed a place to cry. I went to the school's ""peace room"". I might've gotten out the fact I didn't feel like living and didn't know what was the point. Tht I've been having those thoughts for months. They overreacted and called my mom and I didn't want to put that on my family especially with what happened with my brother. So I don't really trust to get help from adults or professionals. Maybe all of these things add up to why I'm feeling this way. But I'm sure it's not tht just one individual thing. I'm not planning on harming myself anytime soon. But if I got hit by a car tmwr I wouldn't mind and would be relieved. I don't call myself suicidal. I think I've just lost my motivation to live."

But you deserve the help. You shouldn't have to deal with this alone. 

Especially knowing mental health issues might run in your family. There is no shame in that. But it also means this is less likely to go away on its own. 

You are loved. You are worthy. And the momentary concern your family might feel is nothing compared to the grief they could potentially deal with if this is not treated.

Message them and apologise for ghosting them but explain why you did. Even if they don’t want you back in their lives it’s a step towards better communication. You deserve friends, family, intimacy and support so when your feeling like ghosting people maybe just let them know that you’re not feeling great right now and that you probably won’t respond or message for a while but that you still care for them."

kvv4x4s,throwaway19032024,3,,1711013288,depression," Own family feeding from your anxiety, that's fucked up. 

Due to my anxiety I am unreliable and that causes anxiety to family, I have panic/anxiety attacks, that makes me unusable, especially mentally. Like for past few months I have not answered any phone calls from family because I'm on the edge and I don't want to talk to them in case I kill myself the next day(because i would feel guilty). I am not a monster, I don't want make anyone feel that pain

I have tried SSRIs, anxiolytics. I'm just really tired at this point and I deserve some peace"

kvv6du2,Own_Spring7541,2,,1711014345,depression," I find myself in your situation a lot, except the work part because I can't physically stand for multiple hours at a time \*broke my leg in 2022 and can't walk without pain\* This probably isn't the best advice but I just stay up until I can't anymore then sleep for half the day, The only work I do is doordash, which is very helpful, Other than that I find the one game when I get home, The one song, the one movie, Start playing, listening, or watching, and try my best to forget about it all. I really hope this helps!"

You’re not in a good place but it will pass eventually and you’ll feel happy again. It sucks to go from happy straight back to depressed but you’ve shown that it’s something that won’t completely prevent you from feeling happiness again. I’m sos sorry you’re feeling this way but it’s good that you’re letting yourself cry. Just let yourself be miserable for now because it’s good to let out your emotions. You will feel happy again and I’m glad you were feeling good earlier. Maybe out in a good movie, or YouTube video as well because then you’ll kind of have other people with you but try to have a nice night anyways <3"

kvv3w32,Own_Spring7541,1,,1711012517,depression," A bit of backstory, my depression started when my best friend \*17 at the time\* Hung himself on easter, It hurt a lot, I started slowly doing worse and worse in school, which lead to me getting into more trouble, and eventually me attempting when I was 18. I miss the man a lot, he would always help me out in stupid situations, and It hurts knowing that its almost been 10 years now"

It still causes me pain but it gets easier as time passes. Everybody grieves in different ways, i still haven’t personally faced that demon yet. Ive ran from it so much and never healed. Now i live everyday numb to my core until i physically cant ignore it anymore and i spiral down that path again. Ive kinda come to accept that this is probably something im gonna have to deal with for the rest of my life. I honestly dont know how ive made it this far ive dealt with all this on my own since 10 years old. Mom wasnt emotionally there for me and i have to work on forgiving her for that im just not ready too. Its still too soon. But if i can do it you can too. Theres been so many nights ive cried myself to sleep and thought about ending it all right then and there just so the voices in my head will stop screaming at me.

kvv66nu,fragphul,2,,1711014201,depression, Thats understandable bro. At least youre not as pathetic as i am. Im falling in love with a girl ive never met irl and is 600 miles away from me. Because shes the first girl thats shown me any attention in a very long time. Thats sad.
kvv6rf7,Own_Spring7541,1,,1711014608,depression," Hey, I was at that stage a while ago, I gave up on love though, the last girl I thought I loved took advantage of me while I was on Xanax and I haven't trusted a woman since, The other girl I liked ended up using me for money, and that was in 2021, I let myself get used because I'm afraid to lose attention, and I don't have much attention to give \*ADHD\* so I never truly focus on myself. None of My relationships have lasted long, I don't blame them though, How can someone love me if I can't love myself"
kvv70h7,fragphul,1,,1711014782,depression, Ik you gotta love yourself first thats why its all so stupid im not happy with the man i am so nobody’s gonna be able to love me like you said.

I'm not sure where to go from here, but hopefully, I can distract myself long enough until I find something a bit more permanent. Without going into too much detail, you're right: my situation will never be fixed as I have experienced something irreversible, but hopefully, I can just learn to cope with it.

Being a people pleasers and hiding who you are and your depression because you want to help or just make people happy prove you’re a good person. You’re no where near a piece of shit and you’re a lot better then most. Losing a friend is hard and I know since I’ve lost three, it not easy dealing with that but your memory’s with that person will live forever if you live. They would want you to stay to be happy, they cared for you. Im sorry no one has taken your depression seriously or tried to help, that’s terrible, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t important. I bet you’re a great persona and so many people care for you I guarantee it. You need to live, you deserve to live life and be happy like anyone else. I don’t know if you’re posting this note here to show what you’ve planned or to say what you’re going to do but I’m going to still treat it like you’re going to.

There's no way that you're a piece of shit after I read what I just read just now.

No bad person would hold that much love and passion for the people around them. Not at all. I know I'm just words on a screen as well but I believe you and I take you seriously.

I guarantee the people you've wrote about in this letter, their lives are WAY better because of you. You are worth it and I really hope that you decide to stick around, as selfish as that might sound.

I read every word and felt myself growing increasingly sad and worried that you may soon not be in all of these people’s lives anymore.

I thought I wouldn’t make it past 13 also, I was a reckless child, teen, young adult and sometimes even now because I thought I would be dead soon. I thought I didn’t deserve to live, I had been sexually assaulted for many many years by my step father, and possibly with my mother knowing. Abandoned by my bio dad because I was made out of wedlock and religion. I thought if I was gone then the truth would never have to come out and no one would have to deal with the consequences. I internalized all the mistakes and blamed myself over and over again, because of something I couldn’t control. 2 decades past last week since the first sexual assault. I haven’t completely accepted the fact that I deserve to live. I’ve written suicide notes rewriting and revising, with 1 suicide attempt. But somewhere along the way day by day I got stronger, I started building and dreaming. Day by day I forced myself to heal and accept. Although I’m not all the way there, there was hope for me, and there’s also hope for you and for everyone else. When there isn’t hope sometimes you just have to BS until hope starts to build. 

Me and all the other people here want you to stay. If you feel alone, you are not. Look through these comments and listen to what all these strangers are saying and asking you to stay. You are wanted on this earth by so many strangers and even more loved by the people you mentioned. Please stay, your genetic makeup is from the stars you are unique and special just by being you. The universe will never be able to make you again. If not living for you then live for what you love and the love you give and have been given. Day by day just live, some days will be better than others but there’s also days when the sun hits your face and you feel the warmth.

Think about it logically, no one would need to write this letter expressing those feelings if they never had them, this is also well thought out for being a ""cry of attention"" as you put it as you can just elicit sympathy anywhere else and probably much easier.

kvtpu7s,Mraka936,1,,1710983962,depression," As someone who lost his lover due to depression, I beg you to look into it and try and learn. It's a disgusting killer. I could write multiple paragraphs on how messed up and complicated it is, but the most important bit is to remember depression isn't just ""having the big sad"". It's this lingering darkness in the back of your very soul. You can laugh one day, be a little down the next, happy again...and then one day you feel like every nerve in your body is being poisoned with guilt, rage, misery and so forth. It's not something you just ""get over"". Sometimes it has its roots, like childhood trauma, and other times people just grow hollow and it's tied to their very existence. Sadly it's different for everyone, so my description might only apply to a select few. Goodluck, brother."

What matters is building yourself and working towards an ideal future. 

Start by writing down the kind of life you'd like to have. Then see which one of your habits are taking you there and which are not. Then do the obvious. 

It is not easy that's for sure but as you start taking action slowly you build the momentum and it starts getting easier. 

This is what you really need. Doing this is what'll actually eliminate your regrets.

kvv2s6t,SquareOutcome946,1,,1711011679,depression," I don’t know where to start; this is my story. I’m 25 now. When I was 20, I married a man 7 years older than me. It was a love marriage. After we married, for about a year and a half, he was very good, a really kind person. We did lots of things together, and we were very happy, a really happy and fun couple. We moved to another country and lived there. After a year and a half, he changed. He provided for me and gave me what I wanted, but not happiness and care.

He wanted other women and slept with them in front of me. He only cared about them. I suffered this pain, and my mental health really declined. I endured it all, hoping he would change back to the way he was before. I kept waiting and waiting, but he never changed; he only got worse. Then there’s my friend. She stayed with me in our home, knowing my husband was a good, wealthy man. He started liking her, and they planned something in secret. He paid her money, and she deceived me, causing trouble for me. He kicked me out a month ago, even though I didn’t do anything wrong. He treated me so badly, even though I loved him. No woman should have to endure seeing her partner sleep with other women in front of her. I don’t know what to do; I’m so broken now. He doesn’t know how to respect me or my family. Every time he speaks, it’s really hurtful.

He controlled me too much, always wanting to keep me under him. He thinks he can do whatever he wants because he has power over me. He always saying prostitute are better he too much addicted to them. He don’t love normal women he always like women who having sex for money… this words are always killing me. All the time if something happened he takes them side not my side front them he shouting me saying rides things to me. There are some days he with me very nice but quickly his mood change.."

Lets talk something important and significant. 

You are trying to find ways how to die. 
You are thinking how much worhtless are you? 
I am not blaming you, the thing is your brain is a machine just like a wheel. It can work in a progressive or destructive way. 

Your mind is running in a destructive way since 10 years but now it's tired of running that way. 
Also you are more mature now thus you can make your self better. 
If you haven't died even after being passed out and commiting attempts that means you are going to improve yourself. 
Tell me what you are doing to heal yourself? 

How many times have you searched for ways to cope it? 
How many times have you watched videos of psychologist  stating the ways to cope it? 
How many have you implemented and failed? 
How many books on depression and ways to improve have you studied? 

Please you are grown up now and you can do that easily. 
Take psychiatrist help if possible. You may need medicines as well. 
All the best 👍💯"

kvuc6mu,Vegetable_Weird612,1,,1710993488,depression," Hey 
I experienced something the same, past year my one and only bestie that ever came into my life left me. The person already had a couple of best friends beside me and it was okay for me as it is in person. 

That friendship was a year long and I really loved that person because of that I cried lots of time and had some stressed full days. 

I will not say that there is no possibility of getting back together. But the real question will be why and for what.

First why and what was the reason for this break up.
Understand the reason and the chapters why it happened and why you couldn't stop it. If you are the problem then you can easily correct it. If it is another person then you have to wait.

Second what will be the future? If the friendship got together what will be in future positive or negative outcomes. What if the person broke up again. It becomes boring. In many girls friendship they make new bestie.

I think you need time, not new friends or old. The time will teach you and believe me if the person was good for you and was honest with you. You two will batch up together. 

Hope that you and the person get together"

You're not unlovable. You're worthy and deserving of love. You're just having a hard time right now. Being jealous of someone is natural and atleast you recognize that you shouldn't be. That shows that you're self-aware and that's a trait that good men have.

kvpml62,DarkW0lf34,3,,1710929576,depression," That depends on your definition of a 'man' is. If you think just going out and sleeping with multiple women; makes you a 'man'. Then maybe rethink that definition. It is important to treat people with dignity and respect. We don't have enough information, but how is your friend treating these people? Look at how he treats them and ask yourself if you want to do the same? Perhaps find yourself a hobby like reading, crafting, looking at lore, travelling etc. Perhaps you should find a companion, look for a relationship and not just sleep around. There isn't any shame in that. But, if you're just looking for people to sleep with; that is a short term solution. Might I also suggest therapy."

High functioning depression sounds adjacent to what you’re going thru. That being said, don’t take a non-professional word for it. Get yourself to your GP. A legitimate diagnosis could go a long way for you towards working thru getting out of this slump. 

I’m not from UK, so I don’t know the system there. But you should be able to just do an over the phone appointment to start if anything too intense/convoluted stresses you out. Start there! Baby steps, you got this."

I even introduced her to a living cousin of hers she didn’t know existed. So caring, if she knew you were coming over she would wait in the window for you, a cup of tea ready exactly how you like it. 3 kids, 6 grandkids, 7 great grandkids and counting. She loved her great grandkids, she had more friends than me. She was just the best person in the entire world. I don’t feel too shaken by her passing though, I think she had completed life, I’ll miss her so much, but if at the beginning of your life you could pick a way to live and a way to go, you’d pick hers every time. Thanks for asking about her, it’s difficult to talk to her with my family because I don’t like seeing them upset, and strangers don’t tend to ask.

I share the same struggle with friends, and after getting a bit older I have realized that that is all it is, getting older. As I have aged, I have looked back on the lessons I have learned from getting burned from people, and I just don't have the patience for that shit anymore or time. I have a couple of really close friends that I rarely see or talk to, but when I do its like we just pick up where we left off. I consider these two brothers to me and we all have busy lives just trying to survive in all this messed up stuff. If you have people close like that, you have to remember that it is a 2 way street and sometimes have to force yourself to engage, once you get past it it's not so bad.   
But I hear you, and your feelings are valid for sure  
The medication though, that only helps keep you from sinking into the pits of depression, therapy is what helps you heal the root cause of your issues. But that also depends on the person, I have clinical depression and a lot of trauma that I deal with in therapy and will more than likely have to the rest of my life. It's a never ending battle, but the light at the end is that you learn to let go of things, and cope with the future.

Why? Because each week they'd ask me to rate my feelings on this and that on a scale or 1-10. But life and emotions isn't that simple to be boiled down to a number. I can't compare my depression to you and vice versa as everyone has different wants and needs, circumstances etc. I'm married and sometimes hate it and wish I were 20 playing the field.

kvoqkgz,jimsmisc,7,,1710907168,depression," i'm kind of glad to see gay people in this thread mentioning the oversexual nature of the gay community.

I'm straight but I've spent a lot of time around gay men, and I've often wanted to say ""you guys know there are other things that aren't sex right? Or aren't about sex even tangentially? And don't have to lead to sex?""

Anytime I've brought it up (which is rare for fear of being branded homophobic), I've been told that I'm basically a prude and I don't understand what real sexual freedom is like, or that I'm just jealous of all the sexy sex they're always having.

I understand that being gay sort of forces you to be part of a certain community (because you're officially or unofficially ousted from others), but it seems like a lot of gay guys' identities are ""I have sex""."
kvnc8vq,MeroRat,24,,1710887194,depression, People are toxic in general. As a straight woman I hear you loud and clear. I’m sick of men not wanting commitment but still wanting bf privileges so I’ve stopped dating altogether. This generation just doesn’t know how to cherish relationships.

I guess it's because the societal rules about sex don't really apply to them, so there's more freedom. 

Being a woman, I often envy that freedom because it's so fucking exhausting having to constantly explain yourself about having sex.

But I know there are a lot of people looking for a meaningful relationship just like you, and to get that, maybe you need to get to know the people before having sex with them. Sober sex in particular because people just do stuff when they are drunk. Put some boundaries in your life, and you'll be able to filter the bad from the good. :)"

A lot of your complaints are valid if we look at the “mainstream” gay community, but there are tons of awesome gay people that don’t fit that mold. 

I can tell you from firsthand experience that there are lots of kind, emotionally supportive gay men out there that *are* interested in genuine connection, who do *not* focus on sex. People who are honest, emotionally vulnerable, and loyal. 

I’m not sure what the secret to meeting these people is exactly, but personally, I try to always be kind and genuine, and I think that naturally attracts other people who are also genuine.

So, just hold onto that. Ignore the world, you don’t need social media, or society to tell you what to do. In fact, take a break from all of this and pursue finding who you are? What you love? And what you want to do? Drop all the expectations from the people and from life and just focus on you. You need love from yourself first before others can love you truly.

I don’t care what your race is, what you look like, dress like, what you believe in…you are worth and deserving of all the best things in life. Just be yourself and love yourself. Get to know you, date you, and I believe that when you start to do that, you won’t care about anything that you wrote because you’ll be too busy having fun with yourself and enjoying your life with you.

Our life’s purpose isn’t…to just have relationships, or pursue some high career, or make lots of money, nothing of that sorts. We exist to experience life just as the trees, the flowers, all the beings on this planet exist to experience it. There’s nothing really so complicated about it. And I do believe that your love of your life is out there, everyone has a match with someone, yours is out there too. While that person may soon be entering your life, you need to become the best loving person you can be so that you can give and receive love to your loved one.

I hope you have a wonderful day, and may your days get better and joyful!"

It was tough as my parents were not taking care of me at the time (mom was heavily drinking and dad was absent) and I really thought I met an older brother/friend who would take care of me.

Society’s teaches people to let go of the weak because they hold you back etc. So depressed ppl are considered weak and a burden to society many times even though we all experience it.

I do believe people are born gay. It's not a choice. No one would choose to be treated bad or bullied. I do hope it's better than the 70's and eighties.

I have spent most of my life as a misanthrope because of this shit, especially since being human means I’m not immune to those shittier traits.

I am a cis het (by circumstance) female, and despite that privilege have found my predominantly queer friend group to be a lot more accepting of me than the cis het world ever was, because is so much harder to create boxes for genderfluidity.  Its a lot easier to be “neurospicy” there too, with all the little wrinkles that depression and ocd can create.

Love is something that is meant to be, and someday it will come to you as well. Personally, as a bi man, it's hard. And it stays hard. The commodification of love has been nothing but a detriment to our society and will continue to be.

Love is precious, and something to hold close. No matter what you cannot give up on the dreams you hold, and I'll admit I have too a few times, but in a quote; ""it's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take, and keep moving forward!""

Honestly the simplest advice is start with what you enjoy. The less something feels like work the more likely we are to approach it. 

I’d also say that despite being told you need to move on, that therapy to specifically address your childhood trauma may be really helpful, assuming you haven’t done a lot of that already. That could be impactful in giving you perspective of why you act the way you do and what you are maybe suppressing that needs a voice to be able to move on from.

Think you’ll be able to ever let go of needing a reason for your illness? Ultimately it’s neither good nor bad, it just is. Maybe letting go of judgement over certain aspects of your experience could be freeing.

kvt7uw1,Catsclaw67,1,,1710977199,depression," Even though on paper people may seem to have it all, depression can still hit with seemingly no rhyme or reason for it.    In many cases there's usually a physiological reason for it that makes certain people more susceptible to it.  Also quite a few studies have come out about there being what's called ""low grade inflammation"" happening in the body for people with chronic depression in particular.  Figuring out what's causing it however is the challenging aspect to it.

kvskfzu,QueuedForDeletion,1,,1710969051,depression," High school doesn’t mean shit let me just start there. You can always get back to it in the future if need be. 

Comparing oneself to others is also a curse that zaps us of self worth. It’s a losing game if there’s ever negative judgement involved. Very few people can see someone doing better than them and flip that into self-motivation. For most of us this thinking breeds guilt shame and self-deprecation instead. 

Personally id say that focussing on your mental health and overall wellbeing is #1 right now. All the other shit will fall in line once you have your baseline health back. And tbh for someone with such deep trauma and extensive mental health experiences you sound very well spoken and frankly, adult. Keep pushing, you’re doing the hard work.

kvs0mwq,Waffles_four_you,2,,1710962400,depression, I think you’re burnt out and and your depressed. A common symptom of depression is low motivation and having to get through the first 2 years of uni while being really depressed must have been exhausting so though you’re better now it’s not surprising that you end able to do much. Just start small with little bits a day. At least you will be making some progress for when you have energy again. But also if you don’t like working that’s fair as well it can be daunting and exhausting realising how long you’ll be working for without much of a break at least not like we used to have while at school. If you’re not passionate about your course maybe just drop out and get a job instead just an easy one at a restaurant or clothing store or something. Or maybe try and find something that you genuinely enjoy like watching movies in bed or cooking. It might be an idea so that you know what you can do when you’re exhausted rather than coming home from uni or waking up and not feeling like you have anything to do that will actually be enjoyable.
kvt49mj,anacoluthon0,1,,1710975896,depression," Personally, I don't like the stigma that depression is a choice to be lazy and that you are purposefully not trying. There is a good reason you're depressed, whether it's some neurochemical imbalance, a health issue, or some emotional trauma. However, you can't shirk away the consequences of depression, so you just have to play your cards the best you can. There's almost certainly a small step you can take that's within your control and not your depression's. If you're delicate and take small, incremental steps, you should be able to relieve some of the symptoms. That's just my take."

kvqsv9a,Biscuito,2,,1710948164,depression," I had similar feelings about food a while back.

I have an autoimmune condition which causes gastrointestinal inflammation which inhibits my body’s ability to absorb nutrients from foods properly.

Even better, the types of foods that can
causes a flare up are basically always the healthier ones.
Refined foods are easier for me to digest I guess, so they didn’t generally cause me problems as often.

The issue is exacerbated by stress, which has always been in strong supply with me.

Food and nutrition at the time was just one more thing I had to worry about every day, and it lost its appeal for a while.

While I don’t recommend the one I tried, meal replacement shakes helped me get through that part of my life where it became too emotionally draining just to eat.

It might be worth looking into something similar that has at least most of the nutrients that you need, and supplementing that with better food whenever you can stomach it.

With several lifestyle changes and a dramatic change of environment I’m in remission now, and I enjoy eating again.
I’m not trying to recommend a one-size fits all solution. I don’t think there was even one thing that got me where I am, but I think it’s worth mentioning that circumstances can change, even internal ones.

As humans, we’re complicated bags of chemicals and even other living organisms that drastically affect our lives and states of mind way more than most people admit or are aware of.

What we eat changes our chemistry, our microbiomes, and our cravings.

I’m not a doctor, nutritionist, or dietician, and everyone is different so this isn’t advice, but it seems plausible to me that sometimes it’s helpful to reset that to some extent with an elimination diet.

I personally find homemade soup to be cathartic and one of the easiest things to make and get down when I can’t muster up the energy for anything else.
You can freeze big batches into smaller portions that are quick and easy to thaw, and if prepared correctly it makes some of the nutrients more bio-available.

I hope you find something that works for you.
Food and exploring various cuisines can be a very rewarding experience."
kvql9as,PurrSniKitty007,1,,1710945561,depression," Eating is an issue for me too. Eating for pleasure isn't really a thing anymore. Medications made this worse. I'm weaning off my meds at home, but so far the appetite hasn't changed. In the mornings I used to look at food pictures and videos of cooking to help me get an appetite. Marijuana helps but after a while it makes getting hungry without it very difficult. That's where I'm at now. Trying to stop using weed to eat but losing weight rapidly. 

I keep nuts around. Anything that goes down fast without prep. I keep garbanzo beans in the fridge. They are mostly flavorless and go down easy. Boiled eggs are also a go too. There is no treatment that i know of. Unfortunately with depression the only treatments are to make you more palatable and productive to everyone else, not to improve your quality of life 😮‍💨

Good luck friend."
kvzf5tx,Professional_Ad4262,1,,1711071744,depression," I’ve had a few people recommend meal replacement shakes, and it’s something I’m willing to try as long as I find one that goes down easy. I used to have a very good relationship with food, however it’s now something I almost dread daily. And I worry about it so much cause I know I need the nutrients I’m not getting and I tend to psych myself out about it most of the time. I used to use marijuana heavily and it helped out greatly with appetite, however I suddenly cannot handle it at all anymore as it causes me severe mental pain and stress. I also feel like my hyper self awareness has a lot to do with it as well. There’s definitely some bad mental habits to be improved upon i just need to figure out how to do that and break the cycle, as I was just fine only a couple years ago"
kvze6g5,Professional_Ad4262,1,,1711071362,depression," Yeah, I used to do something similar and try to look at pics of food to gain an appetite but it usually goes the other way… Marijuana used to help a LOT, however I suddenly can’t handle it at all anymore unfortunately. Makes everything 10x worse. I have a physical appetite but my mental appetite is almost nonexistent. I haven’t ever been on any medication as I feel it’s a last resort type of thing for me. Sometimes I can be kind of excited to eat, however the more I think about eating the less I’m interested in it, and when I go to take a bite is where it all goes south usually. I struggle with a few other (not diagnosed as of yet) conditions, where I would rather do anything else than take care of myself is a main symptom. Such as eating and hygiene. I just feel like I have a lot of terrible mental habits built up that need consulting, and I know medication would only suppress that. The one thing I’m so confused about though is why I have such a terrible relationship with food, as I used to eat like CRAZY, although still a pretty slim person."

kvppzuv,90exhaustedpigeons,2,,1710931773,depression," Job wise, the best thing that ever happened was getting an union job. Having someone in your corner to fill out forms and vouch for you makes a world of a difference. 

I started a gradual return to work. My employer gave me a very aggressive and short window to get back into it after not working for several years. I tried it and failed miserably. It put my whole progress out of deep depression at stake. Union stepped in and was like ""wtf "". The employer didn't even notify the union (which is against the collective agreement). Employer came up with a new plan geared towards my needs and the union have been keeping tabs on me to make sure I'm properly supported. 

Very strong self advocacy and finding doctors and other practitioners that actually listen to your needs and are willing to put in the time for paperwork etc makes so much difference. Hopefully one day we would be able to ""contribute to society"" but so it in a way that is sustainable to us and that doesn't put us in financial problems"

kvotn9t,colorless_green_idea,2,,1710908789,depression," I don’t think you wrote anything incorrect here.

Those platitudes that people spout are just things used to invalidate peoples emotions and experiences while still having an air of being a person who seems thoughtful and considerate. That advice isn’t real advice to a real listener, it’s a social function whose purpose is more about the speaker’s own clout.

I just altogether ignore all those dumb platitudes now. 

The only real advice I can give is to see the world for what it is - a place where toxic positivity reigns supreme and crushes any heathy places for processing negative emotions. 

And no - therapy is not a safe space for processing negative emotions. It’s a punitive space you are monetarily punished for entering. Having to go to therapy is the punishment society gives you for daring to have negative thoughts.

“Don’t you dare have those thoughts around your family, your friends, or the workplace. You can go to THERAPY if you want to talk like that”

And in such a world, the only real option you have is to allow others the healthy place to process negative thoughts that you wish you had. If enough people do this, things can get better"
kvodqoe,12ab57,0,,1710901407,depression," I’ve been thinking that this can be mitigated by being loud. Yes, jobs and SO’s will be comparing you to others (maybe not always SO’s depending on circumstance and jobs if they really need someone), but the more you are you out in the world, the more people looking for someone like you can find you. Does suck that while you’re getting to that point of being you there’s not much support from work and relationships.

I’m sorry that you’re going through this right now. Having been 13 once myself and having had a similar experience, it’s a dark and lonely place to find yourself in. And while it may not mean a ton, I’m here to sit with you through these crappy feelings till they pass. 

I’m glad to hear that you’re able to reach out to your teacher and have some supportive adults in your life. Have you reached out to your school counselor? They may be able to provide you with additional support, if anything they’ll be another person to talk to or can advocate on your behalf. 

As for your parents, while it may be hard to do it may be worth letting them know that you’re going through this. Depression does a great job of telling us that the people closest to us don’t care about us - and it seems like you do a great job of masking, they may not even know something’s bothering you."
kvpf2x8,Alchemist_Messenger,2,,1710923936,depression," 13 is the best time to find something interesting or anything you like to do, whether that’s your academic interests, or new hobbies. The reason why I’m saying this is because you…don’t really have any passion dude. Everyone got something they like, you gotta find that something, build upon it and it will help you to get out of feeling this way. 

Whatever you do it, don’t do it for others, do it for you! Also, your thoughts aren’t facts, they’re just opinions and opinions are never true. You are basically bullying yourself at this point and not even letting yourself stand up and fight back. You don’t have to suddenly think positive, but you can at least, try to stop the track of your thoughts…be like “wait a minute, who’s telling me all this? Or why am I even thinking about this? Did I commit some serious crime or something for me to feel this way about me?” Even bad criminals don’t get such thoughts despite doing so many bad things, you’re just a normal kid, growing up and finding his way around life.

You can do it, kid! This age may be tough but trust yourself and ride through the waves, learn something cool about yourself, find new skills, get new hobbies…your potential is limitless!"

Sorry your going through such a difficult time.

Depression and low self-esteem are really not just a phase getting the help and support you need is worth considering.

With not being comfortable talking to your parents about how your feeling and the things your struggling with if your school has a counselor you could speak with them.

Could you ask your parents to make you an appointment to see your doctor?

If you talked to your doctor about how your feeling that could lead to getting a proper assessment and treatment with meds or therapy if needed.

You can also search online for mental health supports for teens in the area where you live.

If needed the kids help phone is also an option.

You don't have to deal with this on your own and even with your doubts about how supportive your parents would be please consider talking to them and ask them to get you an appointment to see your doctor."

About five years ago I just decided I needed a giant reset in my life and just noped the fuck out of ... oh, pretty much everything except for my young adult kids and my pets. Deleted my social media. I probably deleted 100 phone numbers and contacts. Stopped going to everything (reunions, weddings, funerals, games, holidays) and basically dropped off the planet. Lost a ton of weight I'd been carrying around. Stopped getting my hair done and grew it out. Now with a mask no one even recognizes me around town anymore.

kvpa15w,HooptyDooDooMeister,1,,1710919915,depression," Do. Not. Relapse. 

Some people say ""Oh yeah, I've been there."" I've *absolutely* been there. All I wanted in life was to get married, get a house, and raise a family. Wife left, tornado took the house, and I only get 6 total months out of each year my son is alive. And I'm on the brink of quitting my job because it's too stressful. The only thing I can't relate to is the death (and I'm sorry to hear that).

It may feel pointless to be living for your kids, but I can *not* stress this enough. Your. Kids. Need. *You.* They need their dad. When they're older, they're going to want you around. Badly. They're going to want you to be sober.  And when they're down and don't feel like anything is worth it, you can say **""I did it. And if I did it, you can do it too.""**

Hang in there, my brother. It's hard. VERY hard. But don't forget also, **it's worth it.**

kvolj44,salemlambda,2,,1710904757,depression," Your goal sounds like a completely reasonable one to have.  Close connections to others is at the very heart of having a happy and fulfilling life.  Though, I don't think you should limit yourself to creating a family, though that can be a major part of life.  You just have to be open to it all, allowing it to happen, perhaps seeking it to some extent, but not so much that it forces anything.  On one hand, it's nice when these things happen organically, but life doesn't always come to you, I've found.

Perhaps you should take more social risk, if you are depressed to the point of thoughts of self-harm, the potential reward for doing so seems worth the risk.  If you are already trying, then I'd suggest continue to try.  If you are a kind person who wants a mutually compassionate relationship, and you properly filter out those who don't/can't reciprocate that, then I think things will just work out for you, but of course it can take time.

I hope that you don't hurt yourself, and I believe things can and will get better for you.  Best of luck."
kvolny3,testmonkeyalpha,2,,1710904816,depression," You mentioned therapy but have you tried CBT or DBT?  Intensive outpatient therapy can be helpful too but requires a big time commitment.  That's what I'm doing now.  

I was in pretty bad shape years ago due to loneliness but one day I just signed up for a few dating sites (back when eharmony and match were a thing...  I'm old...).  Took a few years and one relationship I should have ended much sooner but now I have a wife and kids.  Still struggling with depression but life would be so much worse if I didn't just decide to try online dating on a whim."
kvoloir,Exotic-Amphibian9692,2,,1710904823,depression," Hey OP.

I get where you’re coming from and even share the same end goals (I wouldn’t exactly call it old fashioned. Most people would want to marry and have their person.) so I can hopefully give you a bit of insight. 

Like you I’ve always craved a deeper connection with others. I don’t really care what your favorite color is show me why you dance in the rain, show me the things that make your face light up etc etc. 

I can confidently say that things do get better with time but you have to make an effort to reach out to others. Most people are stuck in survival mode, extremely guarded, have a lot of trauma they need to work through, or have hardened their hearts to protect themselves.

You have to get past all that and that takes time. 

For your loneliness, I get dealing with people is tough. I was once like that and the best times I’ve ever had was with another introvert. Doing our thing."
kvoo73q,SciFiJesseWardDnD,2,,1710905995,depression," I'm turning 28 in a couple of weeks. In that time I have never had a girlfriend. Having a wife is all I ever wanted yet its something that has never been even remotely close to me. The loneliness sends you to dark places. Just today I thought about killing myself, again. Unfortunately depression and suicidal thoughts have plagued me since I was about 13. Truth is God is the only reason I'm still here.

I saw your other post about dating and trying to get out there. I would encourage you to do that. Look for another Church away from your parents. Meet new people and become friends. While friendship won't fill the gap of companionship like a romantic partner brings, it is something we all need. It helps. Even if some times the thought of being social seems too much, I would try to get other and meet new people. And with those new people, maybe you will find the person you are meant to marry :)"
kvonjk0,over_it14,2,,1710905683,depression," It sucks because for some reason I can’t seem to have long lasting relationships with others. For instance, I had lots of friends in college. As soon as I left, they stopped answering my texts. Same for other environments. Idk what it is about me that seems to repel deep, long lasting connection. That’s all I’ve ever wanted in life and I’ve never been able to have it. 

Thank you for your reply."
kvontzl,over_it14,1,,1710905818,depression," I’ve gone through years of therapy for the past decade or so. I’ve been with my most recent counselor for 3 years. She does CBT, and honestly I don’t think it’s very effective for me. It feels like I’m saying positive thoughts to myself that I don’t actually believe. Idk I guess I’ve stuck with her out of habit and because she’s really nice, but I honestly think that any improvements I’ve seen (and there has been some improvement,) has been more the result of my own self work than anything she’s done as a therapist. I guess I could try to find a new one but I’m a person of habit so I’ve kinda just stuck with her.

I’ve been thinking about going on the apps. It’s hard because vulnerability is something I struggle with. I get paranoid at the thought of someone I know coming across my profile lol."
kvoo9vk,over_it14,2,,1710906033,depression, Thank you. I’m a deep introvert and it’s very hard for me to put myself out there. That’s why it hurts so bad when I do and the “friends” I make turn around and ghost me. But I’m glad I’m not alone in my feelings.
kvoorhi,over_it14,1,,1710906271,depression," Thanks. I am thinking that it may be good for me to try and find a new church and maybe make some friends there independently. The hardest part for me will be stepping out of my comfort zone. I am a creature of habit to the extreme. I know that going to a new environment and putting myself out there will be really tough, but maybe it’ll be worth it."
kvoqbos,salemlambda,2,,1710907043,depression," College friendships are often pretty surface-level and peter out as everyone goes their separate ways into adult life.  

I don't think there's anything wrong with your personality.  Try to inject deeper and more personal thoughts into your conversations.  Instead of staying in safe topics, ask more personal questions and share equally in return.  Deep relationships form when the social risk is continuously elevated, or by mostly bypassing the superficial stuff altogether, which is more my style.   Whatever you choose to do, I do hope you find what you're looking for."
kvop3ew,Exotic-Amphibian9692,2,,1710906433,depression," People will do what people do. Most people are assholes, especially to an introvert. The best advice I ever received was from my grandmother, who warned me not to harden my heart towards others, despite what they put me through. 

It seems counterintuitive, as you would think that would mean going through the same fault lines of heartbreak again and again and, for a while, that’s exactly what I did. 

What she meant to say was keep the same desire and love that you want to give for others there. Don’t let go of that. If you do you will become exactly like the people who can lose those connections so easily because they refuse to let people get too close to them, or are so guarded that they seem like pricks to the rest of us. 


If you give up, you are liable to become just like the people you so despise. People would think they made a connection with you, when in reality you were just waiting for the shoe to drop and then they are in your position of wondering “why”."
kvopkmb,over_it14,1,,1710906667,depression," Thanks. I would definitely say I’ve hardened my heart to a certain extent, but I should keep in mind the importance of avoiding that for sure."
kvozuv9,RustyTetanusShot15,2,,1710912543,depression," I can relate to not wanting to fix yourself. It takes awhile and you're already used to thinking such horrible things about yourself. But you're not gross at all. You're not ugly. And you can't be that shitty of a person because you care about your actions and how they affect others. Atleast I don't think so. You don't have an ugly face. Your age doesn't matter and neither does your financial status (although I genuinely understand how those can affect you. When we miss our goals or feel as if we aren't doing enough, it hurts like hell). 

You're human. Just like me. You're not a putrid spawn. You're not ugly and nasty. You're human. Me and you are no better than each other. If I don't have to hide my face from the world, you shouldn't have to either. 

I know that it's not easy to accept it though. Compliments or positive thoughts feels like darts and they never hit the target. They miss. Those negative, horrible thoughts however, always hit. 

I'm sorry to hear that you're suffering but please know that I care. Please know that I hope it gets better for you."

Little brother, you can’t let this subreddit and the people in it be the deciding factor in whether you live or die! Practically everyone here is fighting the hard fight. It doesn’t mean people don’t care! You’ve had a rough go of it so far and people have let you down. That sucks hard. But the good if not great news is that you’re still plenty young enough to learn how to fend for yourself, how to be comfortable in your own skin, how to not feel dependent on others for the quality of your life and for how to feel. And believe me when I say to you that this is entirely within the realm of the possible. It’s not easy, in fact it’s fucking hard. Yet you owe it to yourself to give yourself a fighting chance here. There is SO MUCH to learn, and you still have so much time to learn it! Now, you’ve got your plan in place. That’s great. It’s not going anywhere. Keep it in your back pocket as an ultimate option. You’d be surprised how empowering it is to have and maintain a healthy relationship with your own mortality. Give yourself a chance. You deserve it."

kvkbh9h,The-Last-American,22,,1710848065,depression," Those same thoughts ran through my mind when I was your age. It’s agony, isn’t it?

It feels like a dark tunnel with no light at either end.

At one point the anguish was so severe my ability to even *feel* went numb, and all I wanted was to feel something again. 

After many years of dealing with those feelings and struggling with my place in life and in this world, I just broke. I decided to lie to myself. Who gives a shit if the things I told myself were true or not, I didn’t know if they were and I decided to not care.

I started pretending to believe in god again, until I eventually did. I started believing that what I was experiencing was temporary, until it was. And bit by bit, one fistful of shit and mud after the other, I crawled out of it and found myself solid, and *fundamentally different.*

The little stretches of peace that I could find here and there grew, and the things that plagued me, while not *at all* gone, became a bit like background noise and just more bullshit that I was used to dealing with and tossing aside. It wasn’t easy, it was painful as fuck and really difficult, but it was infinitely better than the depression. 

You don’t deserve to feel the way you do.  It’s not your fault and you haven’t had the means or the time to find and develop the tools to combat this like you have it in you to do. 

Whether anyone reads your posts or responds, it doesn’t mean you’re alone. There are a *lot* of people dealing with this same shit, and sometimes it just means lots of people who are hurting aren’t quite able to reach each other like they should be able to.

This is going to sound crazy but give it a shot anyway.

Lie to yourself. Each lie will be a little bit of something to pull yourself up with, and it doesn’t matter if it’s true, it will still work. Some of those lies will turn out to be true, others won’t, and it won’t matter because who gives a shit if when it works. 

When bad thoughts pop up, counter them with something, anything, even if it’s not true. Hell, I’m not unconvinced it isn’t more effective if they *are* lies. 

But do it anyway. Manipulate your mind. It wants stand up on a dark stage and tell you a story of your depression, heckle it. Interrupt it and start telling your own story instead, one that is so counter to its awful narrative that it might seem laughable if you weren’t so sincere. Do it out of spite, do it because you’re hard-headed and insolent."
kvlepev,Sufficient_Door_4613,18,,1710863762,depression," Words and thoughts have more impact than we give credit. Thinking, “nobody cares,” is powerful enough for you to want to die. Ultimately though, is that actually true? No one has done even the smallest of actions? Even if not human, what about your environment? For example, Your immune system fights to support your body every day. Your body is consistently working to keep you alive. Please work on your thoughts. Please try CBT therapy for a few years (I say this, because it took me 3 years to realize how important a change in thought processes is. It gets rid of soo much unnecessary pain.). You could probably look it up online too if you don’t have access to therapy. You have to consistently keep at it. 

Keep fighting❤️

I ended up with 2 kids by 20 (had my first at 19) hoping that the C sections went left and they’d have to save my baby instead of me so I wouldn’t have to do it myself and I put it in my medical directive . I remember in 2020 sitting up with 2 babies and telling myself “I’m not even supposed to be here”. I’m 25 now, and my life sucks some days and some days it’s great. 

I guess my point is, things will change and one day a reason to live is gonna fall in your lap. It gets better, eventually 🙏🏽"

At 25, it's not even that life will get easier; my life has gotten harder in some ways but the depression rarely pokes its head through anymore. I'm still happy despite what life throws at me, and I've learned to take comfort in things I enjoy. A big part of that was finding the right meds, the right friends, and therapy. But I can tell you right now that you can get through this and live a happy life despite how cruel things feel sometimes. You have the power to live a full life, even if the path there may be hard at first. My best friend when I was younger ended her life and it was so devastating for everyone she knew, and looking back I do think she'd regret it if she could. Life is precious. Even now, one of her friends she met in the psych ward, with severe major depression covered head to toe in scars, has managed to recover in her name and is a musician all these years later.

You deserve to live. Fuck dying. Get angry. Even looking forward to a TV show keeps you alive, do it. You need a person to talk to about this. Which you are, on the Internet. Go do something nice for yourself, however small it seems. When you're ready make some small goals to give you positive reinforcement.

Sometimes getting the right job or the right career or finding something you really passionate about can completely give you so much joy and fulfillment in life.  I know life can be really really hard but I look back and think of all the times I wanted to end it and I'm so glad I didn't because things really really really can turn around for you.  Try your best to confide in somebody you know and I think you would be surprised how caring and helpful people can truly be.  I'm truly sorry for you and I don't even know you but I promise I do care.  Please try your hardest to connect with someone you know in your life.

You've mentioned your family. To be upfront, at my lowest of lows, that's what kept me going. Mainly just their disappointment and sadness. Y'know, like thinking of what I would put my own family through (finding the body, dealing with funeral arrangements, etc.). Even harder to think for me the guilt they would be riddled with, the sorrow of being gone on birthdays, Christmases, etc. for the rest of their lives. No parent wants to bury their child, y'know? I've seen parents who've lost children, and they never look the same again.

Of course I don't know your situation. Just thought maybe sharing what's helped me through difficult periods might give you some more time to rethink things. I do hope you change your mind and rediscover the magic and beauty of nature and life again."

If you give up at 18 and stay inside all day posting on depression reddits nothing is going to change.


Go to a bar. Get a new job with new coworkers. Move somewhere new. Actually interact with new people instead of avoiding or just going through the motions of talking every day.



It's hard to put yourself out there, but you have so so so much time in a normal life span to find somewhere worth being.

kvogsyh,RustyTetanusShot15,2,,1710902677,depression," >I know I’m young and am probably trying to rush into stuff, but I think I’m in such a hurry because everyday it feels like my world’s ending. Everyday my thoughts get worse, everyday I contemplate suicide and I just don’t know how much I have left in me. Which is why I guess I want things to go well for me now.

Not to take away but I've had this feeling too. It's almost as if I'm on borrowed time and I can physically feel it in my chest. Plus it does help when people constantly ping pong on the topic of time. ""Life is short"". ""You still have time"". ""The years go by quickly"". ""Take it a day at a time"". When you're constantly told these things, naturally you want to achieve happiness quickly so you can enjoy your life.

>I also hate that depression makes me feel unloveable, that since I’m sad nobody will never love me, and that I don’t deserve to love anyone because of it. I understand love is human and I crave it so back but I can’t help but think it’s selfish to put that type of burden on someone else, so I just continue to be alone. I wish I had someone else but maybe romance isn’t for me, maybe I’m the type of person who deserves to be alone. But all I want is so desperately to have someone else, someone who loves me and will talk to me. Why can’t I have that?

I'm mainly here for this though. You are not unlovable. You're fighting a mental battle everyday. That doesn't make you unlovable at all. It's only selfish if you get with someone and don't try in my opinion and even then, you wouldn't be unlovable. You're already taking steps. You're trying your goddamn hardest and I'm proud of you.

You're worthy of love. You don't deserve any of this.

Also please whatever you do, find a way to stop harming yourself. I know it can get addicting. The feeling of your mental anguish leaving your body because you've opened a wound of some sort is very cathartic but it's not good in the long run. 

What do you like to do in your spare time, if anything?"

It sucks, man. *Really* sucks. Losing pleasure in life's favorite things is so painful that it's stupid. 

Took me a good while to realize I've been going through a lot of grief. Grief over losing interest in things that are supposed to make me happy. It's a sense of loss that is hard to deal with. It's just managing those feelings, y'know?

Do you have any friends or family that you've shared this with? Anyone you feel comfortable sharing this about? If you want a good shot-in-the-arm, that's usually good for some quick medicine."
kvpm7r7,Sufficient_Door_4613,1,,1710929318,depression," There are few things in life that make me feel alive. One of them is adrenaline sports like mountain biking and skiing (I do them safely and with skill, not recklessly, to receive adrenaline). On my depressed days it can take at least 30 minutes or more for me to even start to feel a little better. It’s annoying, but sometimes you just have to keep at it until your fully engaged in what you are doing. Learning is another thing that takes me a while to fully engage, but when I do, my mood usually goes up because I was fully engaged in something besides my own thoughts.

kvpot49,Sufficient_Door_4613,1,,1710931034,depression," Spending time with others is important, but I’d also keep in mind that people are not always available to do stuff.

Go into it thinking, “even if someone isn’t here to do this hobby with me, I’m going to show up for myself and have fun.” For me, it’s hard to make friends, so I’ve had to tell myself these things as well.

I've suffered severe depression and know what that hopelessness feels like, but no matter what you can't leave your kids without their dad.  

People may try to convince you that life is worth living for x, y, z reasons and it can sometimes make things worse when you realize that x, y, z reasons aren't enough to change your mind. Beautiful sunsets, Christmas day with your family -- whatever people try to tell you is ""great"" about the world doesn't feel like enough when you're in that mindset.

You don't have any obligation to feel good about life or be happy, but you still can't leave your kids here to deal with it all without you. Get help, get medication, whatever it is to keep that from happening. You know how shitty life can feel, do not any take steps that will guarantee that your kids will feel it too."

Please do not do anything to hurt yourself! By doing that, you are only passing your hurt to your children and wife. They love and admire you and they probably see you as the coolest person they know. They probably hope that when they grow up they’ll be just like you. 

However bad mental health does exist. You are not any less of a man for sharing how you feel. You may have heard this before but the right therapist can help you a lot and shed a new light. I’ve been through many terrible therapists until I’ve found one that has reallly helped me.

I obviously can't even imagine the kind of strength it would take to do it but I do think it's quite important, both for you personally and for the general safety of kids everywhere."

I went through CST and was continuously raped by different men from 5-14, it leaves you so fucked up. I can barely function as a human being. I remember almost every single detail of the abuse over that decade. I relive it every night, the nightmares make me not even want to go to sleep. 

Is therapy an option for you? I couldn’t start talking about what happened to me until I was 18 to avoid mandated reporting but when I did I started seeing someone who specialises in child sexual abuse and it has helped. If it’s an option for you I really recommend it. 

Again, I’m sorry you had to go through that."

I feel so useless and like a burden on my mom since I can't work. I did IOP at two separate facilities and asked my psychiatrist what else I could do to help. Her answer was a third round of IOP. Like the first two didn't help so why would I do another? Is that it, IOP or nothing and I just continue to suffer?

To a depressed person what you’re saying with this is: “you’ve already been suffering this long what’s a few decades more of suffering and pain?”

I think you’re either very young or very privileged and are all too sheltered from how bad a position most people in Western style countries are finding themselves in right now. With reference to housing, cost of living, etc."

I figure while I am sad and think about suicide I'm gonna die soon enough anyway. I enjoy things like looking at sunsets and sometimes the smell of a spring day. Is there anything that makes you feel good? Super small like that? I bet there is. Stick around for a while. I agree you should be able to die if you want to... but I bet you don't really want to.

It wasn’t my intention to be dismissive of your struggles. But there is a possibility for things to get better. Yes, the future years might well be filled with pain and misery, but you were strong enough to make it this far. I’m suggesting to you to hold out a little while longer. It sounds dismissive, but what do you have to lose? If you die now, there’s a 0% chance at things improving. But if you live, that chance is above 0%. That’s the only reason I haven’t given up completely. I try to cope with this existence the best I can day by day. Even though I want to give up. Again, sorry for sounding dismissive, but this is what I feel. 

Try to find the smallest source of joy. Any reason to keep living. You might find something you weren’t expecting. I truly hope things get better for all of us who are struggling."

kvwbzn5,-sufferingsoul,1,,1711033549,depression," On your side 100%. Good on you for standing your ground against the intrusions of others. It's perfectly reasonable and appropriate to ask someone why they're asking you any question, especially if it concerns personal aspects of your life.

Don't let anyone make you think that you have an attitude problem or victim mentality for upholding your boundaries, or that you're wrong for thinking the way you do. Often times when we tell someone ""no"", they reveal their true selves and prove that you were right to trust your gut."
kvwdlv6,-sufferingsoul,1,,1711034114,depression, I believe that OP was perfectly justified in asking the reason for the question. The other person is the one who escalated by claiming OP has an attitude and a victim mentality. To me it seems that you're antagonizing the wrong person.

So many suicide posts. Very sad and hard to deal with when you yourself are dealing with depression. It would be nice to be able to just discuss depression. 

There’s a sub called  r/SuicideWatch which is probably the better place for these posts. I wish the sub r/AdultDepression was more active with general discussions of depression."
kvms3fy,Ritsler,2,,1710880340,depression," Yeah, I know what you mean. I selectively check this sub because some people can be overly negative where there’s not much to say, and I’ve also attempted to reason with some people seemingly feeling suicidal without much success. I mean, I get it. Depression sometimes makes me feel horrible too and like there’s no point in trying anything that might make me feel better, but downvoting people trying to help doesn’t help anyone. 

I think this is a sub that you should only be active on for short periods of time for your own mental health, though I have found a lot of posters to be generally empathetic and compassionate."
kvlh4g9,,1,,1710864576,depression," We are all in different stages, man. I always see posts here I laugh at but it's a good laugh. Like ""haha can't wait for them to hit that pick up moment"".

I fell in love with a guy in high school, and he and I went out for a while after graduation. I was in a couple of bad spots physically, bouncing from one abusive parent to an abusive roommate, to two more abusive roommates, and he was not in a position to let me move in. So I asked him to give me time to get settled and safe, and I'd come back looking for him. He agreed, and I moved away. I attempted to unalive myself a couple times, and then sought serious help. We both saw other people in the year I was gone, but when I came back, we both felt ready to commit to each other regardless of my mental health. We've been together ten years now, and we're literally blissfully married. He is my biggest supporter, and I am his, and we both believe that me taking the time to get safe and get mental help really did our relationship good. We also believe seeing other people was good for our relationship, because we each learned lessons from those interactions.

Sometimes separation can be a good thing. It's not for everyone, but I hope you'll give this some serious thought. You don't have to wait around and be a chaste little nun while you wait for him to sort things out. Live your life and follow the path before you. Just don't close your mind to the possibilities in front of you."
kvpiym3,THROWRASignifi106,1,,1710926988,depression," He has asked me to not separate, he said that he needs time and we can keep talking but not be in a relationship and in this time I can move on if I find a better man.

kvoffeu,Such_Set_8302,1,,1710902104,depression," Thank you for your comment, I've already reached out to guidance counselors and a therapist. I've been taking meds and it doesn't seem to work and I just feel like everything is so hopeless. I don't mean to say your advice isn't appreciated but I just feel like I'm in a endless void of just pain. It's almost impossible to focus in class or do any homework because I always feel half alive, and tired. I feel very guilty for not doing well in school and being such a useless person to my family's. Thank you so much for advice though"
kvmgnxd,piratecaptainlof,4,,1710876527,depression," I can't imagine what you're going through. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that. It probably doesn't mean much, but if you ever need to reach out, I'll be glad to listen"

kvlmd7k,seriouslydavka,13,,1710866424,depression," It’s very hard to say without being intimately familiar with your relationship. Usually only something that the people in the relationship and maybe a therapist will have enough knowledge to advise on. 

I can say personally, my bouts of bad depression, during times of extreme stress, when I’m trying a new medication and handling side effects poorly, during any big life change, etc. I am prone to finding a lot of fault within my partner. This happens now with my husband and before with previous relationships. Luckily, now I understand that I can really turn on my partner during these times. Everything they do will annoy me. I will convince myself they aren’t pulling their weight. I will be less interested in sex. At the worst, I’ve definitely felt the desire to end a relationship. 

But therapy has taught me it’s always me. I’m ALWAYS the problem. This isn’t true for everyone. Some people have toxic partners. Your wife might be one of them. You say she criticizes you and if that’s true, it’s not a good indicator. Or the relationship itself just became toxic and full of resentment even if she isn’t generally a toxic person. For me, I’ve always really had lovely partners. I’m lucky enough to still be good friends with my two past serious relationships. But I can become toxic. And if I’m depressed enough, I can truly make myself believe I’m not “the problem”. I always am in hindsight though. 

I really think couples therapy is the least any married couple can do before calling it quits. What a shame it would be to come out of your depression with the right mix of lifestyle changes, therapy, and medication, just to realize the relationship wasn’t the problem. But again, only you know what goes on between the two of you. No one here can really tell you anything."
kvlzke7,ricka168,3,,1710870816,depression, Perhaps a weekend away would end the tension ...if u feel better alone. That's a clue..if not try to get some meds because the problem is inside of YOU
kvn0352,AnimalGoddess0113,3,,1710883009,depression, It’s hard to give an opinion because I’m not in your brain or your relationship. I do know that being in a crappy relationship will make depression an issue. I think it’s important for you to take some space from her and see how you feel. Say you’re going on a work trip or something. Take a week off work and go chill in a hotel. See if your depression lets up a bit. If you dread going home. If you smile more and feel less heavy.
kvlxbh2,themustacheclubbitch,2,,1710870075,depression," I can love anyone. Catch me in a bad mood or depressed or having bad anxiety I will leave you at the bus stop! It’s so a me thing. I don’t want to put anyone through it so I need to take “me time” and handle it myself. It’s honestly one thing that most people can’t understand unless your family and eventually get it. My family knows if I’m not feeling it or having a bad day, I just say. Just need a little time alone, I’ll be ok. And they get it. :) Maybe express to your partner how you are feeling, maybe not overly honest, but communicate :)"
kvl7ztr,saucekiing,3,,1710861463,depression," Hi, i understand. I wish i could offer some good advice but all i can really say is maybe talking to a therapist about it. Maybe its your depression causing it, or maybe you do hate her. Possibly staying with your wife is causing some more depression. Id really recommend talking to a therapist tho to explore more. If youre able to get one, id say talk with them a little bit before making a big decision with your wife. I hope you can feel better soon. Wishing the best."
kvlb1ee,VenusLoveaka,3,,1710862516,depression, Maybe a marriage counselor would help. Then you can both reconcile where the hatred is coming from and constant criticism on her end.  Then she can find a way to address situations without triggering your depression.
kvlblyj,Swimming-Sea-5530,2,,1710862711,depression," Yeah couples therapy, if you want to work on the relationship. At least for your peace of mind."
kvlwp23,,1,,1710869865,depression," Listen to me, I honestly do not need to hear you, and believe me, no one wants that either. Either it is a matter of compassion or it is a matter of charity. We all suffered from the same and the same thing. I hope I will be harsh in my message, but what I can offer is that it is your problem and you are responsible for treating it. There are six remaining.  Months in a black room just because I gave up trying in circumstances for which I am not responsible, but in the end I am responsible for me and for the thoughts that will enter me and how they will enter. But now, I see from my point of view that your treatment is that you develop your mind more until you are able to be in harmony with yourself.  And friendship with her, and you must love her and not flog her. Just be compassionate, merciful, and always remember: Don't feel bad, about feeling bad, it's ok to not be ok.  I would be happy if you wanted to talk more, and I wish you success.💚"
kvnq6r4,aquatic-dreams,1,,1710892301,depression," Oh it makes perfect sense.  But if you're that worried about it  you don't have to be,  the longer your depression goes unchecked.  The longer you keep not doing the things that your brain is screaming at you to change( and it might not actually be your wife,  it could be that you've become way too passive and because of that you are resenting your wife but she hasn't done anything wrong.  She's doing what she feels is proper. You could talk to her about what's bugging. You could even tell her you miss the connection and the fun you two used to have and tell her you want to start marriage counseling to get back to see if you two can have a new stage in your relationship with that fun again. I can pretty much guarantee if you're unhappy in your marriage, so is your partner.  They might be walking on eggshells and trying to keep everything 'safe' and low key with you and accidently they're driving you crazier.  How the fuck would she know? I'll bet she can feel the tension in your house and doesn't know what to do about it. ) or you can continue how you are and the more time that goes on, the more likely your wife is to divorce your ass. And I'll tell you right now, unless you are sure you want to get rid of her,  divorce can be a fucking miserable pain in the ass. And if you think shit sucks now.  Wait until your worried about paying rent in a shithole and realize a lot of your depression was caused  by a lack of new adventures and a lack of friends and now you're not only down one more,  you're paying them alimony.

You need a best friend as well as your spouse. It's not fair to expect them to be both.  It's too needy.  And that goes for her too. 

I don't know shit about your relationship.  You or your wife.  But if you can get help and have fun like you did in the early time in your marriage, I don't understand why you wouldn't try. The alternative can be an amazing sense of relief that brings a level of relaxation few things can come close to. Or it can be one of the worste things you'll ever go through and on average it takes men 1 1/2 years in average to accept and move on.  Either way,  I reckon starting therapy now is probably a good idea. And if after 3 visits the therapist or the marriage counselor is helping.  Crack jokes about them to your spouse about them and find a new one."

Talk to HR about your depression to help protect your job.  It's a recognized disability so they need to make reasonable accommodations if those would help you."

Recommend therapy,  and tell him you'd be happy to find him a therapist and schedule an appointment for him.  But that you ask that he will let you know if he thinks it's helping after 3 weeks and if not the therapist will become joke fodder, and you'll help him find another."

I don't really know what to tell ya. I understand not wanting to smother him. But at the same, if he is avoiding you.... 

You can swing by, say hi, check up on him, and ask what the deal this and why he hasn't been replying. And he very well might lie as to what's going on and why. 

Or you can take it as, if he won't reply to me than i don't mean that much and fuck it, I'm moving on.  

Not knowing either of you or the full details makes it kind of hard to give real advice. And it's super easy to say if he's not replying fuck that guy. But seriously, just ask him.

Now have I SH since on it? sure but I also am able to work and my outbursts I can feel coming on and it's not nearly as frequent ...if that makes any sense. So I have ample time to seek help, whether it be a place or person. 

I honestly resonate with almost everything you said and strongly suggest lamictal. It's not going to fix everything but I'm 90% sure it would help, especially considering you self harm and I'm going to guess you have issues with control or the lack there of.

kvmpsnl,GhostLynx,1,,1710879575,depression," Why is that you want them to understand? Sit on that for a second.

What I’m gathering here is that if you are able to find the right words to bring them to a real understanding, then they will treat you better. This is not true.

And the belief that a real understanding of your feelings will change things stems from an entire underlying belief system. I think the most helpful way you can approach this is to tackle your beliefs from the bottom up. 

I recognize that you value empathy very highly. From that, my guess is that you assume other people value it similarly.

kvgztw4,RobertoBolano,254,,1710790509,depression," You’re a good grandkid. 

My mother is significantly younger than your grandmother (early 70s), and it took her a year and a half to really meaningfully start to recover from my father’s death. 

At your grandmother’s age, losing a husband is not like losing a parent or a romantic partner would be for you or me. Not that those losses are not tragic. But for her, that loss is the crumbling of an entire lifeworld—she has lived her life for over 80 years and one of its constants has become dust. 

It is *entirely normal* for your grandmother to be thinking about death, both the concept and her particular dying. With rare exception, people do not reinvent themselves at 84. The life she knew is gone, and she is struggling. 

It is good of you to worry, and it is good of you to care. The reality is that you cannot do anything, not right now. This is a frustrating thing to accept and it is something I had trouble with while navigating my mother’s grief for my father. We are young and we think youth can do anything. You must wait, you must be patient. 

You can be there waiting with kindness and levity and love but it is not within your power to fix this. Your grandmother will emerge from this or she will not. Do what you can for her but do not do it expecting a certain outcome—do it because it is a kindness from a grandchild to a grandparent."
kvgwyvk,Irefang,459,,1710789554,depression," She lost the love of her life, the person she had been with longest, there is no recovering fully, it will always be a wound in her heart.

kvh3bug,luvawe,53,,1710791681,depression," My condolences for your grandfather.

My dad and my mom were married for 49 years. My mom met my dad when she was 11 and started dating him at 15. She had a terrible situation at home and my dad was her only constant in life. He was the love of her life and she was his. 

He passed away recently and when my dad was in the hospital my mom had a heart attack because of the stress.

It has been a bit over a year since his passing and the hard truth I’ve had to accept is that I understand how she feels, having the person she chose to grow old with just taken. 

They would travel together, they would go to the grocery store together, get their every day coffee just to get out of the house. After a lifetime together you get into a routine with your partner. 

And I’ve had to accept that if she lets herself go (ie, not going to get her checkups, not eating right, not sleeping, etc) there is nothing you can say or do that will change this. 

This kind of grief is more than a depression and grief, it’s the loss of a future, it’s mourning a part of your heart. 

The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is be with her. If she is sleeping, go take a nap with her. If she is in her room ask her if you can do whatever you have to do (homework, reading, etc) in there. And there is absolutely no need to talk, just keep her company because the thing about grief is that is the most lonely journey. 

Sending you a big hug"

kvhjljl,SweetCorn0405,23,,1710797194,depression," I understand that you only have the best intentions in mind. But the road to hell is also paved with good intentions. 

You have to think about what happened from her perspective. She's in her 80s, near the end of her life now. She's been married to grandpa for presumably 20+ years. Of course she's going to be absolutely heartbroken and wretched, not just because she lost her husband, but because she lost her life partner, the person she spent possibly half or more than half of her lifetime with. Grandpa was a crucial part of her life with the time they shared together so it's gonna be some intense yearning and her suddenly having to get used to his absence, which is clearly hitting her hard because she's already old and near the end of her life anyways. 

And as rough and cold as it sounds, you cannot truly help someone no matter how good and pure your intentions, or how much you want to help, if that person doesn't want to accept help, change, improve, etc."
kvgzd9s,sunkissedxglow,19,,1710790356,depression, My condolences to your grandpa. I would suggest therapy to help her cope with the lost and find ways to manage grief.
kvh4jep,etti1612,10,,1710792089,depression," My Grandma is the same since my granddad passend away nearly ten years ago (not so much these days because of Alzheimers). Before she was moved into an elderly home, she lived on her own, we tried to make it as comfortable as possible for her but all she ever said was something like, why do you care, I will die soon anyway and so on. It is really hard but you have to remember that they were married their whole lives. They spent so many years together and went through so many good and bad times, this isnt something one will get over in a few months. 

Maybe tell her, that you are worried about her and maybe encourage her to tell you stories about them from when they were young (maybe she has some old photos to show too). Play games with her or take her on short walks. She has to learn to live on her own after a whole life spent with someone by her side.

Edit: spelling"
kvgz7z4,SoggyWoodpecker1816,9,,1710790306,depression," I'm so sorry to hear about your grandma's situation. It's not easy dealing with grief, especially when it comes to losing someone you love deeply"
kvho8zw,mzshowers,9,,1710798809,depression," My main suggestion is to make it a habit to go over (without calling if you feel she’ll say no) and ask her if she needs anything done.  My aunt just lost my uncle at similar ages and one of her grandkids has been stopping by on Sunday to see if she needs help with anything.  It’s a great excuse to make her accept some company and talk a little bit so she doesn’t stay in isolation.  Even if it’s something like “hey grandma, I thought I’d just drop by and see if you needed anything.”  Often older folks have tiny things that go into disrepair, need lightbulbs changed and all kinds of things that would be easier for someone younger to do.  Maybe you could even run some errands together.

Another idea is to tell her how much you miss your grandpa and ask her to tell you a little bit of family history.  Tell her you’d like to write down your genealogy for your own potential kids someday (if you’d like to, that is).  That would open her up to sharing about your grandfather in a space where she feels really comfortable to do so.

Ask HER for help with something and she’ll feel very useful, which she probably feels the opposite of right now.

I don’t think anyone ever gets over this.  We lost my dad almost thirty years ago and although she has remarried, my mom still misses him terribly.  So do I.  I’ve realized it more and more as I grew out of my teens and into the rest of my life."

kvijp3a,cyaneyed,5,,1710810536,depression," I am not an expert in losing the love of your lifetime.

That said, a warm bath/shower does wonders. It’s something that people struggle with when they get older.

I would say try to take a shower for me grandma, just today. Let’s not think about anything else except how nice the shampoo and soap smell.

If that doesn’t appeal, perhaps you can set a chair backing up to a sink with a hose. Maybe the kitchen sink. Maybe put some cushions on the chair. Tell her, she doesn’t have to do a thing, just lean back in a chair with her clothes on and she’d be helping you practice washing someone’s hair. It’s something you want to learn.

Here’s a secret, put some coffee to brewing. Boil some water, make some strong tea ☕️ extra sugar on hand. Cream on the side if possible.

Put some bread in the toaster and have these smells around her and start the water running.

Put double towels on her shoulders, ask her to lean back and relax. She may feel like crying once you start washing with some shampoo and perfectly warm water. It’s just a way to let her know she is cared for, that you love her and it’s perfectly okay to continue to cry and mourn. Just be there, hug, listen.

After the hair wash, wrap her hair up. Offer some buttered toast with sweet jelly/jam on the side.

Have coffee available. The toast. Maybe, if you’re feeling super adventurous, make some bacon.

She doesn’t have to eat, but surround her with the most delicious smells known to man. And if she doesn’t go for it, ask her nice questions about your grandpa while at the table with the food. Nibble the toast while she talks. Maybe fix yourself some hot chocolate and put a cup of it in front of her."
kvhrzf4,ejdhdhdff,5,,1710800136,depression, You are helping immensely by being there for her. Talking helps and maybe planning something simple like a walk or a game now and then. I’m not sure how old you are but you are helping by simply being around and being an ear. If you can get other family members involved in terms of getting out of bed or out of the house you can help her get through this rough period.
kvj9io7,KillerOfAllJoice,5,,1710821773,depression," I take the unpopular opinion that after living a certain amount of time on this earth and with a distinctly large life behind you, one can make the conscious decision of when they'd like to die. 

And that's okay. Eventually, everyone has to go. To be able to choose when to go is a dignified choice everyone should be allowed to make. She has lived a good long life with her lover and likely wants to move on to be with him in the next. I don't cater to that belief system but I fully respect her right to do so."

kvhvfhz,lupuadrian,4,,1710801395,depression," Mourning is a normal experience this recent from your grandpa passing but she is showing signs of depression. Wanting to die and go be with our loved one is different from actively feeling and thinking that active suicide is a good ideea and having a plan about it. 

Black shades and isolating herself could be a form of both. Watch out for signs of active suicidal thoughts, plans about it, physical signs of malnourishement, delusional ideas or hallucinations.

I would suggest offering her to take her to a psychiatric evaluation for a light antidepressant, some therapy if she is open for it. 

Try to stay in touch with her, expose her to light, eat at her home even if she does not. 

Good emotional processing would be nice if she is up for it (talking about her husband, sharing memories about him, regular visits to his grave with candles or whatever ritual you have held). For a while, it is hard to believe he is gone and the void remaining is too much at first.

Be patient and present."

kvj1kyz,identityisallmyown,3,,1710817871,depression," It's hard to help someone who is depressed. 

she should see a doctor for depression. She may not want to, though, and she may ignore any advice she's given. 

Personally, in times of tragedy, I've found victor frankl's Mans Search for Meaning really good to read. 

If she were my friend, I'd open the windows and get some light and air in her apartment. I'd encourage her to at least take a walk around the block or find a bench outside and sit - even for five or ten minutes a day. Feed some pigeons or just look at the trees. I guess I'd tell her that her husband would want her to keep on living for the both of them and that he'll be there when it's her time. And no matter what, I'd keep showing up and just let her say whatever she says (sometimes you have to tune it out because it'll be so depressing and negative), and show up again and again and again. If she wants to, hold her hand."
kvj9b4p,Adventurous-Low-4280,3,,1710821662,depression," My grandpa took his own life after my grandma passed.

I wish I had been more active in doing these things for him. 

We thought he was getting better/happier, but it turned out he had a plan for himself. It was only a couple months after grandma's passing. Maybe help her find and be in community too. Loneliness is hard.

Also, I've heard you should ask someone directly if they're considering taking their own life. If you are scared for her physically, you may want to do that. There are online resources for how to handle that conversation too."

Do you live in the same area that she lived when she met your grandfather? If so (or it’s not too far) you should ask her to show you the house she lives in when she was a young girl. Where did they go on dates? Where he grew up. Get her in the car & have her show you the places even if some are gone. You might have to tell to get in the car & not leave too much room for discussion. Record it with your phone & say you are making this video for other grandkids & future generation to have! It may motivate her to do it. Show her how technology can give us things we never could before. Ask her how she would have felt if she could have seen a video of important parts of her great grandmothers life? 
If you live near the beach or a large lake try to take her to just sit for 10 minutes. If it’s further try a day trip. There is something powerful about staring at the waves, the sound & smell. It can be a sad feeling but in a good, weird way"

kvjhqu6,tina_Z68,2,,1710826657,depression," OP, you’re a great grandkid for noticing this and thinking about it this way. Losing someone at that age is earth shattering in a way you and I can’t understand. 

When I was in high school, my grandma lost her husband of 70+ years to Alzheimer’s. The disease took a few years to decline, my family was fortunate it wasn’t longer. Going through this caused my grandma to act similarly to yours. 

I remember people in my family telling her things like time to move on or get over it. While their intentions were good as weeks turned into months and months turned into years, they were entirely at a loss of what to do. 

I was in high school at the time, so I didn’t fully grasp the situation. I don’t really have advice to give as much as I can tell you what I wish I did looking back. 

1. Tell her you’re there for her. Older generations aren’t always used to receiving support from younger folks. Be clear with her you care about her and her feelings. 

2. Don’t shy away from talking about her relationship. Do the opposite - work to learn more about it. They clearly were together a long time and had a bond stronger than most ever achieve. This is admirable, and you can learn a lot from her about relationships and life just by asking her to talk about it. This is the only thing she can think about right now - so use it as time to learn for you and get closer to her. 

3. Make sure to show empathy for how monumental of a loss this is - one most people can’t comprehend. And be kind to her - tell her how much she means to you, and how much having her relationship as a role model  has impacted you. 

As others are saying, you’re a great grandchild. She is lucky to have you."
kvk4tx3,clullanc,2,,1710843989,depression," This is very normal. Many old people die within a year after their partner has passed. The worst thing you can do is making it about you. 
And the worst thing that can happen isn’t dying. Losing someone when you’re young is something entirely different than it happening at the end of your life. For someone who’s also lived their entire life for and with their partner, like many people in their generation have, there’s probably nothing left in many cases.

You’re ofc allowed to be sad about this. But it’s her life, and she shouldn’t be forced to suffer the rest of her life for someone else.

The empathetic thing to do is to console and listen to her and show her that you understand. Anything else will make everything worse"
kvk8udg,njoy59,2,,1710846538,depression," My mom and dad had been together 55 years when dad died. She was the same way as your grandma. But after 14 months she told me she had to ‘ kick her ass and get up’ those were her words. And she did. She lived 10 more years without dad. Time she spent with grandkids, great grandkids and her cats. She enjoyed life those 10 years. But never stopped missing dad. 
She just passed a few months ago. I really miss her."
kvkdmnj,Troponin08,2,,1710849211,depression," My grandpa passed away last year at 93. My grandma followed him 14 weeks later at 91. 
She told my husband after my grandpa’s funeral that her job here on earth was finished. She stopped eating and did her darndest to get him as quickly as she could. They were a month away from their 70th anniversary when my grandpa passed. 

From my experience, call, visit, and give the gift of your time as much as possible. But take care of yourself as well.  If any of her behaviors trigger you, set your boundaries. But do it in a way that won’t upset her. IE- If the dark house is hard for you, stick to phone calls. 
You can’t change her mind, but you can show her that she is loved. 
It’s tough as hell. 
If you,or another family member, can accompany her to a doctor’s appointment, do so and voice your concerns."

My grandma is prone to depression and my granddad just had a stroke last year but he has survived it though it’s taken a toll. I’m afraid that the same situation will happen to my grandma once my grandad passes. 

The best thing I can think of is to try to get a therapist or professional help, but I personally know my grandma to be very stubborn - she’s not going out to see anyone she doesn’t want to - so if yours is similar this might hard to do.  Maybe if you are able to, spending more time with her trying to do regular things at home that she used to enjoy (cooking, watching tv, chatting? Any hobbies that she used to do?) might make it easier to start enjoying things again with someone to accompany them. This might open the door to gradually do more things that improve her mental health, it could even make it easier to get her to accept professional therapy.

   Honestly, if someone at that age has lost their partner and doesnt want to be here anymore, We should respect that. It's unlikely their life situation will improve at such an advanced age and living in that pain isn't worth living. We are young, it's hard to conceptualise what it's like losing someone who has been a life partner

If she doesn’t want to go out and do things with you, maybe you could order to-go meals or cook a dinner with her. If you visit, I would just open the curtains.

kvlgk7d,VenusLoveaka,5,,1710864388,depression," I'm sorry your friends are being dismissive towards your feelings.  You and your friends are young.  Sometimes other young people have a hard time addressing strong feelings, even as adults I have some friends that change subject but they are trying  to lighten the mood (because that is the only way they know how to address these feelings).  I understand that now that I am older.  Its not an excuse for way they are dismissing you, but that could be a reason.  The one friend that gave you a long paragraph with a heart: focus on that.  It shows that you do have a friend who cares.  

I'm kind of older and out of the loop on modern trends, so what is a gc (if you don't mind me asking)?"
kvlkshe,holamarina,3,,1710865891,depression," you are not a weirdo, there is nothing you are doing on purpose, and you should be listened to and cared.  
If at least one friend is willing to listen or respond, just THANK him/her for being there and tell how IMPORTANT it is to you. remember to do the same for him/her in time.

and also, perhaps it would help to talk to someone older, a nice cousin, a cool aunt, a close teacher..."

kvnvr6w,aquatic-dreams,1,,1710894388,depression," You can last way longer.  The fact is... something needs to change.  You've tried a bunch of things which is awesome! But before you mentioned ADHD, I had thought you sure were describing some of its symptoms. And I think that's where you should start. Seriously,  make an appointment with your doc. Write down on paper what you want to discuss in advance,  in case you forget or play off things you should be discussing. And bring the note,  and keep to what you write down.  Don't use your phone for that,  you might feel weirdly self conscious or it may feel weird mucking with your phone while talking to your doc.  So don't bother just use a paper note. 

If you have adhd, getting on meds and getting your serotonin will not only help with all the chaos in your head,  it's really weird at first.  But it will help your depression chemically,  and because you'll find it easier to get shit done. It could help your depression two fold. But if you don't have it,  then well shit. At least you know for sure.  But I'll tell you as someone late diagnosed, Adderall has done more for my anxiety and depression than Celexa, lexipro, and cytalopram and that's aside from quieting my head and making tasks easier to start. So from my perspective it's worth finding out if you have adhd and if so treating it."

>!I have enlarged tumors in the uterus pushing upward and affecting my lungs and bending my liver. A month ago I had just gotten over pneumonia because of it (after getting the flu) and had a few asthma scares.  To add, they thought one of the tumors could be cancerous.!<

I hadn't had any money or health coverage in the past for this type of surgery so health situation got worse. I was homeless for several years, relying on the charity of others.

But now I am getting full coverage for surgery and I can't believe it. I'm so happy I'm still crying. 😭"

kvo54f7,aquatic-dreams,1,,1710897983,depression," I think most of us here would love ❤️  to die. I don't know about you but I've been ready to go for decades.  There have been great years and awful years,  found out I have epilepsy while driving on the freeway, had a stroke, lost everything in a divorce,  watching my best friend slowly die of brain cancer... I've been ready to go this whole time.  Sometimes I long for it, sometimes I don't.  It is an underlying theme. But I keep ending up having fun,  getting curious,  or caught up in something  and when I'm not caught up in something I just remind myself I can off myself at any time,  so let's not rush it  and I put it off for a few days.  And then I get caught up in something for a while.  And then I put it off again.  And if i hadn't put it off I wouldn't have experienced nearly close to what I have.  And I wouldn't have interacted with nearly as many people.  And surprisingly,  I don't annoy the living fuck out of most of them.  Like I am you;p  Because I am not you and you don't care.  And I don't care about that either,  so it evens out.

I started to put it off because I didn't want to be the dead friend. And it became a habit.  And really,  you could do a lot worse."

If it is and you are in a brain fog, you're gonna need counseling specifically for PTSD"
kvm3q2p,No_Professional4602,2,,1710872202,depression," I think it could have something to do with multipotentiality, you like and are capable in many things so it's like you're over stimulated and it's difficult to focus on a single thing, you see people around you being passionate and doing good in one specific thing and you're like ""why I can't do it? why I manage to do many things but there's not a single thing I master perfectly? why do I lose interest so often?"", you become self aware and start thinking you're a fraud, people told you you were good in many things but you feel like you're barely mediocre and start feeling less capable and intelligent than other people and it's like your prediction becomes reality, you start having problems focusing and studying, you feel like you're not able to do simple things because your self awareness sabotages you and it becomes real. Of course there's the chance that you developed a disturb of some sort but I feel like it could be the thing I mentioned before, you could try a path with a psychologist in order to reduce your anxiety and improve your self confidence, the power of the brain...is scary!! Good luck!"

kvs6vd2,Greenyleen,1,,1710964499,depression, Don't force her into doing things she doesn't want to do as it may stress her out. Though her not eating is concerning but it happens with depressive people. If you want you can just hang out with her in her bedroom. Even if you don't directly interact with her. Just do your things but in her room for like one hour per day? So that she doesn't feel too lonely?
kvnqy7o,xxDooomedxx,1,,1710892586,depression, Psychiatric meds are a trial and error deal. If zoloft isn't working for you you should speak to your doctor about it. You may well do better on another AD. I tried a bunch before I settled.

I have my moments.  I just get super silly, play with the dog, and act like a child.  It's fun. The kids love it, and my wife tolerates it.

Find your thing.  Anything.  When my dad died (suddenly, heartbreaking), I picked up origami and did it during grief counseling.  It's just something to keep my brain focused on progress.

I looked up ways to counter it, one thing that helped lessen the blow of depression was looking for a positive thing in each encounter. So if I drop my ice cream, I have to think about something positive in that situation, ""Well, at least it didn't land on my shoes"" it makes the blow a glancing blow instead of a straight up hit. Took a few months of forcing it before it became 2nd hand. Doesn't work for everyone, but it's helped me a bit. Also look for something you enjoy doing, I've found hiking to find beautiful views and waterfalls fun/relaxing. 

Some weeks are worse than others, but finding something you enjoy doing, or something that makes you calm, definitely helps my man. I wish you all the best, and hope you find something that makes you feel a little better."
kviqyxt,ThothofTotems,7,,1710813404,depression," I’m a normie with a past of clinical depression and suicidal thoughts.

I saw a youtube video which helps me a lot in this. It is a religious video but the message is basically “you don’t live to find happiness but to find purpose”

Everyone has a purpose in life. Hence everyone definition of happiness is different and so does their motivation. 

What I did that helps me get out of my depression was finding my purpose of life. I look in many aspects of my life from religion, family, career etc and while doing that, I just let my life move on.

It’s affecting my relationships with people, it’s bad but weed is the only way I’m able to sleep through with no nightmares and I’m able to do work or go about tasks. Sometimes I cry about it cause I think I’ve been chosen to break my generational trauma but at 27 (f) I don’t think I’m brave enough to keep digging and fixing my pain in order to straighten my strange behaviours, I can go half way but I guess I’ll give the rest to the next generation to finish off these curses. It’s so lonely and painful. I just wonder what id like if those horrors never happened to me. Gosh I just know I’d be an incredible and successful woman.

There was also a childhood event (no, not abusive) that made me more susceptible to me then having conditions that I do have. If you can figure out what a goal you would like to achieve then that could be a step in the right direction. I would also suggest therapy and possibly medication. Though that is up to you, your therapist and doctor."
kvl4xdm,RockStarZero23,1,,1710860380,depression," Please try to stick with me here, coz it could be a long read.

Back in High School which was 13-16 yrs old, in a third world country, we would wake up at 4am to start breakfast and get ready for school. Breakfast consists of a few slices of bread and water. Grab public transportation to reach school by 6:00am to do flag ceremonies and start school proper at 7am. No lunch, I was too broke for this so I just watch my classmates eat. I just  pretended that I needed to do homework. Catch public transpo again and hope to reach home before dinner, if there was any. Luckily my father would work all day so we have enough for a few days worth of food. Before bedtime, me and my friends would chat and joke around, every now and then would dream of a better future. On the weekends I would try to find anything to make some money. May it be errands, construction, etc. Luckily I never had to resort to drugs and prostitution like my other friends. I'd rather pass out in hunger than do those. 

Everyday was the same dance to the same tune. But, we had to put that one foot forward and follow it with the other every single time coz we know no one will get us out of that stupid cycle but ourselves. 

We were always tired and depressed, but we had no time and space for that in our minds. Survival and to be a better person occupied us."

kvhw6gb,throwawaykaworu,32,,1710801672,depression, It’s just different levels of depression. Some people have ‘high functioning depression’ where they think everything sucks but still go through the motions of daily life. Sometimes the mask slips and they end up crashing.
kvkfwb1,el_jello,8,,1710850356,depression," They are driven by emotions. They don't understand the concept of ""thinking about thinking"". They base their whole identity in whatever they are thinking/feeling on that moment.

More rational people begin to understand that thoughts are actually something external to us, something that can be challenged, something that don't actually represent ourselves. Once you understand that, a whole new set of concepts begin to develop, and you can recognize irrationality more easily.

This whole process can be actually fueled by traumatic experiences that challenge and reveal our own limitations, you become more grounded to reality. That's the reason why depressive people are more ""thoughtful"" and repulsed by ""normal"" people who don't seem to experience the same hardships.

The problem with depression is that it can actually gain momentum and make the mind to become identified with a hopeless view on life, which is no more than another scenario of lack of critical thinking. Once again, the depressed person, like the previously mentioned ""normies"", can act based on pure thought or emotion."

&#x200B;

i started lifting at 16, got pretty big, was in the best shape of my life at 19, but thats when the shoulder issues started, then elbows, then the tension headache, and recently when training legs my knees and sciatica have been acting up. no matter how many physios i go to, they cant fix what ive got. i now look small and pudgy, which is so depressing. i have to first fix my shoulders, because theyve been bothering me for longer than everything else ive got. im now seeing a physio thats the best in my entire city, since starting his rehab protocol, my right shoulder has improved, my left shoulder has only very very slightly improved. but then days like yesterday and today pop up when my shoulders feel unexplainably shit out of nowhere, and then it feels like im regressing again.

&#x200B;

ive gone from being able to lift heavy and feeling on top of the world in and out of the gym to feeling like my 16 year old self again. i feel stupid going to the gym, as im only able to do light weight rows, light weight arms and legs. seeing all these people getting bigger and stronger while my body isnt changing is so dispiriting. it would be one thing if i had a choice to get bigger and stronger but failed to do so, but i physically cant, because of my injuries.

&#x200B;

i relate to not enjoying anything. i am always sulky and moody, its been so long since ive been truly happy. im sorry youre going through this, but know that youre not alone. i actually searched 'injury' on reddit to see if anyone else could relate to me, and yours popped up. sometimes it feels like youre the only young guy in the world going through serious injuries."

kviwiuu,k4skyes,2,,1710815662,depression," Hi sweetie. I’m so sorry you feel so sad. Losing your job is really tough.

It may not feel like it but you are so young. Any sense that you are behind or that you should know what you’re doing by now isn’t true. Your 20’s are for figuring out what you like, what you’re good at, what you’re interested in. And through that discovery process you must also learn what you don’t like, what you’re not so good at, and what you’re not interested in. In the moment, those lessons are tough, but they’re very valuable. Life doesn’t make sense in the moment, it makes sense in retrospect. We have to stick around long enough to look back and see how our path led us to where we are. 

Right now, you’re in the thick of it, and nothing makes sense. It’s so hard. But you can do it. You can do hard things. You’re a brave man. You’re strong. And you are capable.

Can I ask what your hobbies were? And what did you like about them?"

kvixkhl,k4skyes,2,,1710816102,depression," Congratulations on passing your bootccamp! Have you taken a moment to congratulate yourself and acknowledge what you have done rather than beating yourself up for what you haven’t? 

We are so hard on ourselves. I think that you passing your bootcamp is an incredible milestone. Not everyone can say that. I certainly can’t!

Learning any skill requires time, patience, and discipline. Sometime it feels like we’re not evolving, but if you keep calm and work at it, one day the thing your thought was impossible will be easy.

Try to take deep breaths if you get worked up. Maybe take a little break every 25 min if you’re working through a hard challenge. Rather than going on social media, go outside and stare at the sky for 5 min. Try to hear the birds or notice the colours. Then go back to your problem and try to understand it very slowly.

But that’s a thought for another time. I’m hurting, but it’s not over her. I cry out of joy because she’s happy and it brings me pain knowing I couldn’t do that, but I did for years with the pain in the abuse on both sides irreversible maybe a few years from now we could be friends and I told her I don’t want a relationship with you. I don’t even want to touch you And I regret those words I’m sorry I have a lot of baggage 😂😂😂 i’ve just seen so many stories on Reddit of the exact same thing happening to me so I felt less alone about it and yeah, I broke no contact last night, and the no contact was up to her you can read on my other post. I was missing her childhood dog and she’s the only person I could talk to about it because no one else in her family or anybody I knew knew that dog and I told her I’ll never give anybody what I gave you and that was my love, I don’t have love for family.

kvpkalf,Kp767,2,,1710927968,depression," I feel like because of how your childhood went, you probably didn't experience having a connected family. But my point was that there will be something that motivates you to better yourself, you just have to find it. I'm just lucky enough that I know what I want my future to look like at an early age.

  
Also, your past relationship might not have worked out. But you know what you did wrong in that relationship. First step of fixing a mistake is to admit that you made a mistake, so you already are ahead of a lot of people that are in a similar situation as you. Just remember your mistakes, own up to it and move forward. You can't change the past so what purpose does it serve to lament over it? Tell yourself ""I have made these mistakes in the past, its fine. Let's just not do the same mistake again"""

kvkp6ku,comeonvani,2,,1710854511,depression," Sounds like depression to me..I am not sure though, it might be something temporary too..like just a bad phase

You can look up to free tests online, they will make you answer some questions related to day to day life and how you feel and then will give the results, though I'm not sure how accurate they are

If you can afford a therapist i would go for it rather than self diagnosing

I hope you feel well! Take care!"
kvl08eh,liminalb0y,2,,1710858713,depression," I am not sure about it being temporary. I had it when I was about 9 or 10 when  my parents got divorced. They got me a therapist for about 6 months, and that shut it up for a little bit, but it came creeping right back when we had moved countries a few years back and it’s stuck ever since. But on the other hand, yeah, it could just be a phase, but I’m not too sure about it or my future, if there even is a good one for me. However, either way, I have to give a thank you for this little interaction , so you have a good day as well."

kvynn3n,PrestigiousBus2664,1,,1711061423,depression," Man you gotta start fighting for yourself! 

I’ve fought depression and intrusive thoughts my entire life (33m). I’ve always been chunkier than my friends, even when I’m in decent fit shape I look chunky if you see me with clothes on. I struggle with social anxiety and anxiety in general, I never feel fully confident in myself and I struggle with meeting new people. 

The last few months, I got out of a relationship with someone I assumed to be my life partner after 11 years. It wasn’t because of my issues, she was always supportive of that, but it fucking destroyed me and put me in the lowest low of my life. It motivated me to get real help, and find the best me. Learning to recognise my triggers through professional help was my first big step. It took me 3 different therapists to find one that I clicked with.  

For me any form of social media binging is my biggest trigger, to the point that I now put a timer on for like 45mins or something to stop me falling into an episode.  I’ll then switch it up to do some chores, read a book or go for a walk etc. 

I make sure to try and stay socially engaged with my friends, even when I don’t feel like it. I’ve always hated “alone time” until I started working hard on it recently. 

I’ve learned what “self care” means to me. I love to mountain bike personally (even though sometimes I resent going, that’s normal), so I started building myself a self care routine around that. I’ll go out and interact with the world to get a coffee etc, go for my ride, go for a sandwich at my favourite deli and then have some downtime. Then I’ll reassess what I feel motivated to do that evening. 

I’m learning that I have amazing qualities to my personality, and that I’m a beautiful person in my own way. I’m not perfect, but who is? People who portray themselves as “rock solid” and show no vulnerability are the ones with the biggest insecurities.  The most toxic trait of depression is comparing yourself to others who are “doing great”. I’ve started thinking “fuck them, I’m on my journey”. They all have issues and are probably thinking I have no issues. 

You can do this! Take small steps until you feel ready for big strides. Maybe you go for a walk today and just take some time to find one thing you appreciate in the world at this moment. Please consider limiting your online presence, there’s a real world out there that would love for you to be a part of it.  Remember you have the power to change everything in your life, you just have to fight for it."

kvuwt18,EqualRights4Men,1,,1711007042,depression," I mean the idea of the screen going blank forever is more crippling than the idea that I can potentially change my world view even if it's cloaked or bubbled to avoid negativity. I have a buddy who doesn't know anything about politics or the atrocities going on around the world. He lives a happy peaceful life in his bubble and he's okay with that. I could do that too but I don't because I like the chaos. The chaos is generally too much for most people to handle but I love deep diving into all the political influences, scandals, and problems that will never be justified, never be investigated properly, and that will never receive any sort of righteous closure. Everyone is corrupt and everyone will sell their soul for a coin. That's just the way humans are wired. Do what's best for yourself in this world even if it harms those around you. There are so many important lessons that come out of these events.

 Now on to the main topic. Nobody will ever know when their life has come together. You will never be perfect and you will never feel fulfilled. That's just the reality. Humans have the never ending void inside where we always want more. Once you get what you have wanted, its on to the next thing, then the next, and so on. Its why wealthy elites get bored of their mansions and women/men, and look to politics/building space ships. There are people of all age groups trying to ""figure their life out"". But the truth is you never will. Everything is spontaneous and random. Life is not linear as it seems.  You can hypothetically improve your life by getting in shape, wearing stylish clothing, driving a nice car, and partaking in ""feel good"" activities, but it will never fill the void. The void will always be there and the goal is to ignore it as long as we can so that we can attempt to enjoy this world that we were thrown in. A world that will be gone in a split second and a world where everyone and everything will be forgotten. Life is an ""opportunity"". It has limits and MANY cons. But we still try to utilize what it offers to get something out of it until our screens turn black forever. I like having my screen on, and I think you would feel the same way"
kvjdd0u,NoAlgae7411,1,,1710823905,depression, Yeah I think it's worse for our generation
kvl2z97,AkLeMo,1,,1710859694,depression," I understand how you feel. Every day it's like waking up like I'm chained to the bed. I feel hypersomnic, no energy at all, no motivation or drive to move forward. Even small things like taking a shower or eating food have become mammoth tasks, like I'm always on survival mode. If a bad things happen, I go into a very bad place, and if good things happen, I feel like I don't deserve it, and end up in the same very bad place. It's difficult to function and motivation seems like it's dripping out to the point I can't even do the thins I enjoy anymore, like I've become anhedonic.

As much as I didn't want to, I've come to terms that I need to see a professional to understand why this happens, and what I can do about it, even though it's insanely hard to. If you haven't seeked professional help yet, I would suggest that as something you could try, to maybe find the underlying causes, because once you know what it is, you can begin to deal with it, which is insanely difficult when you don't fully understand what's happening.

Hearing that you've struggled so much and got where you are in itself, is so inspiring to me. It gives me some hope that life, at least in some ways, can get better. But I also understand that no matter how beautiful the car may look, if the engine is always overheated, it will inevitably break down. I feel like I personally have reached the amount of break downs that I can take, and I want to take a look at this engine in every angle and understand what the problem could possibly be.

I can understand the sentiments completely, and it's difficult for someone without hope to provide hope, when I lack it myself, I understand that. But its comforting to know that I'm not alone, and neither are you. Just the fact that you're still looking for help and asking questions, is such a big step. Whatever you've accomplished and are still accomplishing seems downplayed, because not many will understand the massive amount of effort it took every single day. But I do, and I'm sure a lot of people here do. 

I don't have all the answers, I don't know if all the answers are out there, and I don't know if running out of questions would also be equal to running out of hope. But we're here, and we've made it this far, and I hope we can look and find what can help us, since we feel we have nothing more to lose."

kvi84v3,Two_Blue_Eyes,13,,1710806107,depression," I think there are people that just cannot fathom what depression is really like. “Why don’t you just get up?” They don’t get it and sometimes their lack of knowledge makes them say things that seem ignorant.

kvj27tr,allisun1433,3,,1710818162,depression," I get asked how I am very often and sometimes it is hard to answer that because I always am a mix of sad/suicidal/lonely/bored and that answer stays pretty fucking consistent- so like overall not well, but it feels like they expect a different answer magically. especially when my life is extremely boring due to me having a few chronic illnesses that leave me debilitated. Like no, obviously I’m not okay. And I don’t necessarily want to talk about it because nothing will fix it, talking doesn’t change anything. Makes me want to rip my hair out of my skull sometimes."

Because sitting in the house was really driving me crazy and made me have a mental breakdown. Far as faking your happiness. I’ve done that because my friends needed me at the time and i rather one of us be sad then both of us. So I put them first and making them happy even if it was just for the day made me feel kinda happy. And people do think about you, I’m thinking about you right now that’s why I’m up at 5:00AM writing you this long ass message.

Back then, I didn’t cry either, I just had this pit in my stomach and wasn’t ambitious anymore. I didn’t care. Why don’t you speak with a doctor and I believe there are some good online quizzes to try check. You may have a mild form and even when I’m depressed I don’t cry often until I completely break."

They arent able to over compassion or understanding because they lack the ability to. Limit your exposure to these people, and remember that how they treat you isnt an indicator of anything other than their lack of understanding "

kvnz6a7,Popular_Medium7656,1,,1710895683,depression," I feel this in my soul!!

I’m 20 years old right now, and I live alone. I’m about to move out of my apartment and live with my father and my mother who are going through a toxic divorce after 25 years of a toxic marriage that stripped me and my siblings of our childhood.

I feel like my father doesn’t understand because he really doesn’t suffer from these types of things very often. He’ll get down in the dumps every once in a while. But I’ve only ever heard of him being suicidal just once before and recovered from those thoughts pretty quickly. For the most part he’s a very well put together man.

I suffered from a brutal attempt last year. Literally almost died, was bleeding out internally and had to get a rod and some screws in my femur(that huge bone in ur thigh) for the rest of my life…. And I still wanna fucking die. I just feel like life is genuinely miserable. Most of it, not all of it. So what’s the point if literally 90% of my life is terrible?

Unfortunately I can’t just surround myself with people who show more support because I don’t have anyone who can or will. I don’t have any friends and my siblings and I don’t talk much anymore because we’re all grown. I just feel so alone but at the same time I’m wanting to be alone because it seems like my energy is really rubbing off on others. And it makes me feel like a huuuge burden.

Even my sister started cussing me out about going to a hospital when I just wanted to tell her what I was going through and just needed someone to listen about a week ago."

kvk0qah,vexingfrog,2,,1710841087,depression," Stopping eating and starving yourself is a surefire way to lose control of your life, not gain it. At first it will feel like you have control but eating disorders trick you like that and you will eventually be under control of your ED. All the things that make you depressed now also won’t be solvable with an ED. I’ve struggled with anorexia for over a decade now, trust me it’s not worth it. You think your life is miserable now an ED will just guarantee it continues to be that way, if not worse.  

To answer your question it would depend on which medications, most aren’t recommended to be taken on an empty stomach and you may upset your stomach. Additionally a lot of medications are absorbed better with food in your stomach, not eating can make them not be absorbed properly and therefore less effective."
kvk1fhp,UnknownPleasures3,1,,1710841609,depression," I had to address my ED before dealing with my depression. Are you getting help?

Starving yourself will most likely lead to binging, it's just an evil circle and it is super hard to get out of."
kvkig0z,Borgiroth,1,,1710851577,depression," Fasting is good, but you need to learn about intermittent fasting.

As a kid, my parent did not feed me, full stop. I grew up a really scrawny kid. Once I started to get friends,  I was lucky that their parents fed me. 

Once I started working as a kid, I was able to buy food and learn about nutrients and the importance of protein, fiber, vitamins, etc. I started to gain weight pretty quickly because my metabolism was used to nothing.

Fasting for one day, and then eating SUPER HEALTHY, but also SUPER conscious of the composition of my meals on the days I ate. Then, you can afford to fast for a full day, only drinking water and maybe some sugar free energy drinks. 

Then the next day you can eat the things you craved that whole day, but make sure it’s healthy. Or a healthier version of what you want if it’s a burger and fries. This will also teach you how to cook a lot of foods you didn’t know how to cook beforehand, and if you live in America, you will save so much money buying food every other day, or groceries for 4 days rather than 7 for the week."
kvl6unq,_killing_floor_,1,,1710861059,depression," I would suggest checking out r/fasting. They can help you a lot better on medication aspect.

That being said, I would suggest you to better start with r/OMAD and/or r/keto first for one or two week so that you can get comfortable with it. That alone will make it a million times easier if you plan to move on to longer fasting durations.

You will definitely be able to lose weight at rapid pace. However, key thing is to adopt more healthy diet and having smaller portion size. Once you figure this out well during your fasting phase, you will be able to maintain your weight like a champ without devoiding yourself from food that you enjoy.

Also, important thing to keep in mind is to stay hydrated and have adequate electrolyte. Pretty much any sort of cravings, sudden mood swings or other issues during fasting are usually due to lack of necessary salts."

What would it take to make you feel better? 

Feeling needed? 

A job?

Simply feeling fitter/healthier?

Forgive the simplicity of my questions. It’s how I think when my mind gets so very muddled and I fall into a deep despair. 

The only way I got out is to keep my thinking very simple. Some thoughts are downright scary. Sometimes I don’t even know what I want. No fucking answers! When I get to that point I tell myself that no matter what, I love myself unconditionally. It doesn’t matter how much of a loser I am, I love myself unconditionally. No conditions to this love. I can be ugly. I can be worthless. I can be friendless. I can be a laughing stock to the whole world. I can be evil. I still love myself, because there’s no conditions to this love. Here’s the thing: you don’t even have to believe it. Just say it. Just say: I love myself unconditionally. Say it over and over. 

I set ridiculously simple goals like make a cup of tea, back to bed. Make a sandwich for lunch, back to bed. Be easy on yourself! This is a very tough time for you. Be delicate with yourself and give yourself that unconditional love."

So trust me when I say lose all that weight it’s a game changer. I feel like a totally new person. I went from being depressed to being happy last year just from that. Now I walk into stores and women just look at me now, I’ve had success with females like crazy since I’ve lost weight (I’m 6’5 so that helps even more😂)"
kvizr6c,k4skyes,3,,1710817053,depression," Sweetie, you have done an incredible thing already. Have you taken sometime to acknowledge the brave, strong man who has the discipline and grit to stick to a plan and lose 50lbs? That’s no small feat.

You are so young and you’ve been through a lot. I’m so sorry to hear about your dad. I’m sure that wasn’t easy and it affected the decisions you made. Sometimes we use food and shopping as coping mechanisms, and that’s okay. You can’t beat yourself up for that. You dealt with an incredibly hard thing. And you made it. You survived, and now you’re starting to thrive. I know if doesn’t feel like it yet, but nothing and no one is an overnight success. It takes small steps, consistency and dedication. You’re on the path and I’m so proud of you.

Look into grants, look up grant writers too if you’re overwhelmed with the application process. Don’t be afraid to pick up the phone and call support on grant websites or email support. Ask for more information, ask to have a call. Ask them to tell you how to optimize your chances of getting a grant. Call up your school too. Ask to speak to an academic advisor. Tell them everything about your situation and ask them for help. These people are in the jobs to help people in your situation. Don’t be discouraged if a few them are unhelpful, there will be those too. But if you keep looking you’ll find some people who are able and willing to assist.

Make yourself a nice cup of tea, put some happy lo-fi on, maybe light some incense of whatever makes you feel calm. Start building a plan slowly. Gather your applications, phone numbers, email addresses. Make a list and go through it slowly and consistently. 

You can do this. I’m on your team ♥️"
kvg7iy4,Wooden-Program-1670,2,,1710780982,depression," Thank you, the main the thing is the money though. I’m in school, and used all that money. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to pay for next semester"

kvga9dd,aKoZyDay,3,,1710781919,depression," Yeah that’s gonna be the hardest part, but you can do it, just think of how good you’re gonna look in a few months. I can wear clothes I never thought I would be able to fit, now I wear designer clothes instead of having to shop in the big and tall section (I’m 6’5 250 btw lol) it’s all in your head trust me now I don’t even eat fried or fast food till this day!"

kvg10dv,Illusion-Eye,5,,1710778777,depression," From what I understand, it's not the lost feeling that is keeping you down, it's the fact that the feeling of being lost has no purpose to it- no arc. 

You're only 21, you're perspective and views are limited by your experience with your reality, but there are some things you can do to change both reality and more importantly your perspective and experience. And no I do not mean drugs. 
Being in your situation, I would travel. Go anywhere, find a simple job where you are staying or in the area, and move on when you're done with the place. 
Meeting new types of people in new types of environments that are always changing, might allow you to expand horizons, or even better- miss your own reality.
 
You will not hear this advice often, so I hope you'll at least consider it. It won't be easy, you might encounter realities, places and people that are even worse that what you already knew. But you might also find a life-long friend, a lover, a business partner, or just experience something more fresher-looking than what your mind is used to see. 

Harming yourself would be a loss of value for the entire world, a giant loss for the human race, just as any such case is. You have done nothing dishonorable, wrong or of any guilty nature. You give yourself the chance to experience life first, for all it's beauty, then, reconsider the option if you must. 
You have no need for skills in order to observe the world around you, do you?"
kvhcrog,Nemeczek_,1,,1710794873,depression, Its so sad :c
kvhzjtq,RuleInformal5475,1,,1710802910,depression," I haven't read all your post, so sorry. Just had a quick glance.

My experience is that I was born to immigrants in the UK. I didn't really fit in and got my education. During my PhD, not having any friends, I realized that my life was going to suck. No friends, can't fit in, work for money and not have any life at all.

One thing that changed me was that after my PhD and 8 months unemployed, I got a position in the US. I got to go to New York. From small town olde York to an actual big city!

It took a while, but I could find all the things I needed. Friends, a sense of joy. I was happy. 

Sadly that time came to the end. I was unable to find a job and my visa ran out. Back to the grey UK with my tail tucked between my legs and off to live with my parents. I tried to bring that self here and it didn't work.

I haven't smiled and meant it for the past 7 years.

But now I know I can smile. Location is important. I don't think I can get back to New York, and I know it isn't the same as I left it. I try to fill that gap with travelling.

My point is, there is a chance, and a strong one, that you can smile. For me it was getting away from the grey vortex of the UK and British people. Location can make a major difference.

The future isn't set yet. You just have to find what works for you and don't listen to anyone else. 

And on that last point, feel free to tell me I'm wrong."
kvi8wbn,Wondernerd87,1,,1710806396,depression, Honestly? Neither do I. But it doesnt stop me fighting every day to stay alive
kvilltp,Kids_cry00,1,,1710811284,depression," I’m having the same crisis. What I did is I used my credit card and bought a trip to Colombia, now I’m working and raising money so I can go and meet a new place. It has given me a little hope, and it makes me continue at least for a little longer. I hope you find a purpose, remember that your mind is the one doing all of this."
kvmqnvg,EpicSpyMainWeeb69,1,,1710879862,depression," True, but that's only the one side of the picture that you're viewing it at the moment, Sir."
kvjv4zk,aKoZyDay,1,,1710836694,depression," You’ll find your purpose in life might not be now but soon you will. It’s weird how I found my purpose in life, I just like helping people and making them smile, that’s why I’m on this subreddit, shit makes my day 1000x better when I get depressed, because I have no one to turn to. So I come on here, who knows I might’ve saved someone’s life today and don’t even know it. Just trust me you’ll find your purpose just keep trying new stuff, far as you wanting to die, please don’t you got family imagine when your gone, now they gotta pay for your funeral and you just added probably more stress onto they life, maybe even put them in a very depressed state to where they wanna take their life. And now it’s your fault they wanna kill themselves, do you want to feel that guilt? If you not gonna stay alive for anyone stay alive for me, you made me write this long ass message at 4:00AM, so now imma be pissed if you cause harm to yourself. Don’t be a pussy you will find purpose and live a great life, believe me please❤️"
kviruig,SadTransportation506,1,,1710813753,depression, Honestly try therapy and idk if you’ve communicated to your husband but try that to I think your blaming yourself for something that isn’t your fault and I don’t think anybody in this sub can help I think you need professional help
kvis2lm,Putrid-Locksmith-722,1,,1710813843,depression," I am so sorry for your loss, losing a baby is auch a heartbreaking experience. Your feelings are completely valid also your hormones are still rapidly fluctuating so be extra kind to yourself.
There is absolutely no one better for your baby than you! 
Do your best to take care of yourself, maybe your husband can take over a few of responsibilities for a little bit to help you get more sleep or just some quiet time to try and process everything. It's a LOT to lose a child physically and emotionally."
kvkcbwx,Curious_creature_33,1,,1710848530,depression," There’s one thing you can do, pick up your phone and call your doctor for support. Whether that means medication, therapy online (if you can’t be bothered driving there). You just need to take one step and that is reach out to a doctor or a family member to call them for you. Don’t think about it, just do it."
kvjj1zd,vexingfrog,1,,1710827540,depression," I don’t think you’re trying to get attention. I struggled with the same at your age. I think it’s a good idea telling someone you’re struggling, whether that be a friend or family member, I don’t think you’ll mess everything up by reaching out to someone for help. I’m not sure if therapy is an option for you but are you maybe able to talk to a guidance counsellor at your school? 

You don’t have to struggle with this alone."

And again kinda this year but I’m still working on bettering myself. Lost a ton of weight that fixed my confidence, now I’m trying to get in a trade to be an electrician so I can make more money. Just take shit one day at a time to better yourself that’s all, you can do anything I swear you can, no matter what age you’re. And I’m doing all this with busy friends and no help"
kvidwsu,Summer_Shark,3,,1710808309,depression," Please, please don’t give up! No matter how you view yourself YOU are beautiful, YOU are strong, and YOU are worth more than you realize. Sometimes it helps to hear that. Your purpose is still out there. Hang on! Keep fighting and never give up! These trials will pass and you will conquer them. And please understand that you do not have to do this alone and you are not alone. Reach out to anyone who will listen, even if it is internet strangers. Im so happy that you did, and I’m truly sorry that you’re going through this and feel you have nobody…but you do.. many are up here because they/we can somehow relate. Whenever I’m facing hardships that seem unmanageable I just keep telling myself that this too shall pass.. and you know what? It does! I’m not completely in my best space today but I’m thriving and know that my face value is worth more than my failures and nonexistence. So If you need to talk with someone, please don’t hesitate to reach out, even to me. ☺️That’s why we’re here to lift one another up and to get answers. 💕YOU GOT THIS!!!"

She probably wanted to forget about that this happened."
kvjo1nv,SecretMelodic,1,,1710831162,depression,"  I wish I knew what it was you should do, all I can do is say what I think would be the easiest way for you to get some help right now. It’s sounds like your scared of what will happen if you talk to anyone in your house/family. I don’t blame you so I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to not tell anyone why you want to talk to a therapist or counsellor but to make sure that you are connected to one regardless/no matter what.  

If your parents care they won’t need a reason to allow you to get some help/support/therapy. This is about your well being and I think it’s important that you speak to someone who can help you. I hate to say it but I strongly believe you shouldn’t speak to your mom about this. It shouldn’t have mattered that he was also a kid, she did nothing when she should have."
kvjp2b3,SecretMelodic,1,,1710831931,depression," It is not harmless, age isn’t an excuse, and it’s a parent’s job to stop this behaviour. Sibling sexual abuse, especially when children are younger is more common than people think. However it’s even more common that out of embarrassment parents sweep it under the rug. That’s not what a parent is suppose to do, ignore the developmental issue of their kids. It was your parents job to ensure that nothing else ever happened again and they didn’t do their job. What your mom witnessed… she neglected to take action towards a serious problem. She was responsible for his sexual development being inappropriate and instead of protecting you she used age as an excuse to ignore what was a major problem. 

She could blame denial but the truth is she is your mom and in situations like this a parent can’t afford to look the other way, be so nieve and exhibit this level of denial that your brother needed to be monitored better and should have been put into therapy when this happened to protect you not him because that was what she did, she chose to protect him and not you. 

I wish I could express how truly sorry I am that this happened to you. It was wrong, and you should have been protected from this happening when your mom knew it was something that had been done once, she should have know that things like this are not a one and done innocent thing. He may have been a kid and didn’t understand but she was an adult and should not have been such an idiot to not do anything about it."
kvhk8nx,DragonBorneUltimatum,1,,1710797413,depression," I know it’s tough right now, but don’t let this ruin your confidence and self esteem. A lot of teenagers go through this. I went through it also. You’re not ugly, you just have acne and that doesn’t change who you are. Try to have faith that the treatment will work and that you’ll overcome this. I hope that you start feeling better soon."
kvi7b34,Youthfulbunny,1,,1710805798,depression, I’m going to be on accutane soon…
kvj1fb0,goldenrodddd,1,,1710817799,depression," Never been on Accutane but I also hate my face but mine is moles/random bumps that I'm hoping a derm can shave or laser off. I'd honestly rather have scars. I already have one near my eye but I actually think it looks kind of cool.

Anyway. It sucks to hate your face because you can't really cover it up entirely on the reg and I just wanted to sympathize. Here's hoping the Accutane helps you and someone else can tell you if it's worth powering through it or not."
kvjz4vw,,1,,1710839889,depression," My younger brother took acutane because he had cystic acne on his cheeks that would not go away no matter what he tried in high school and I also know a girl I went to high school with who also took it as an adult because she got really bad adult acne. Both cleared up like crazy after finishing treatment and have great skin now but both also had a few bumps on the road taking it. Acutane is a last resort for a lot of people because though it works great its definitely a process and it seems to work from the inside out and like you mentioned seems to make the skin worse before it gets better and can be a lot to deal with. I’d keep at it and think about that end result. Each day your closer and closer to clear skin. Your only 16, you have your whole life in front of you. We all had embarrassing moments in school and when your an adult you will look back and laugh at them most of the time. It doesn’t make it easier this moment but remember it takes pressure to make a diamond. Try to think of the end result and take each day one at a time and think once your done each day your that much closer to your end goal. Sometimes our journeys can be a little easier, even if they are tough ones to take in smaller steps, when you look at the whole picture it can be overwhelming. You got this!"

kvk08nr,vexingfrog,1,,1710840721,depression," No, it’s most likely a placebo effect. You won’t start noticing any difference on anti-depressants until a couple of weeks of being on them, usually 4-6 weeks but sometimes earlier. Definitely not after one day. 

You may experience some negative side effects within the first few days but any “ecstasy” feeling would most likely have been placebo."

i’m in therapy but they can only fit me in once a month because portland is so full of people with mental health issues and I’m currently on public healthcare because i lost my insurance when i lost my job.

And i can’t find the energy to do anything like leaving the house is this anxiety inducing process and it feels like my brain is just shutting down"
kvjkl28,Letuslotus,1,,1710828620,depression," Seems like meds aren't working, it's okay, try to eat as much as you can and do sleep hygiene, face the sun when you wake up, cold showers if you can, and try working out"
kvjuj0i,Electronic_Lynx_858,1,,1710836200,depression," It might take some time for it to be possible. Maybe the right music or a sad series might help the process, but ending a relationship is a hard thing, and you can't really rush things, so everything ""goes back to normal"". It takes time, and in that time, try to be kind to yourself. Take care"
kvk1c12,Opening-Lychee-4195,1,,1710841538,depression, Was it a Romantic relationship or a a friendship 
kvkgubn,Powerd_by_rice,1,,1710850817,depression," If I'm honest it was supposed to be a friendship.
But it was much deeper than that, at least for me. 
I found myself giving too much to the point I didn't really enjoy spending time with them anymore."
kvkhtol,Opening-Lychee-4195,1,,1710851284,depression, Wow I can relate with you on that on so many levels😂 I recently had to break off from a friendship as well. It was a really deep bond that she and I had but eventually i fell love with her. Even before I fell for her I did more for her than she ever did for me. In the end I came to the realization that she was taking advantage of that and the way I was with her so I had to put a break and to this day that break hasn't ended. 
kvkhvfz,Opening-Lychee-4195,1,,1710851307,depression, May I ask what caused you to break your friendship off
kvkm4qs,Powerd_by_rice,1,,1710853220,depression," Indeed. It's a very powerful trance when hoping to change her mind, becoming overexcited at even the slightest signs of what was always friendly affection. 
I'm at least grateful I can catch myself before I make a fool of myself."
kvknygy,Powerd_by_rice,1,,1710853999,depression," We had one very intimate moment.
I had a great time, I thought she did, she told me she did. For a week it was bliss, I thought I made a breakthrough
. 
Then the next time we were together, at my place she was acting very distant, and it made me feel very lonely. 
I asked her again the next morning(yesterday) and she said she didn't feel the same way as I did about that day. So I told her I wanted to end whatever this was. 

No calls, no texts. 
She was cool with it, but then she started to act all close again, asking me to help her with things.
I was nice about it the whole time.
But I told myself it was done, I can't go back on my words.
Then she asked me to walk her on her way out. Which I did.
And that was it."
kvkoaid,Opening-Lychee-4195,1,,1710854139,depression, Yet again it sounds like this girl of yours is similar to the one I was with. She's trying to figure out how she feels about you or she knows buy doesn't want to accept it.
kvkq56j,Powerd_by_rice,1,,1710854899,depression," She did say at some point she wanted to wait till after college graduation till she was ready for a relationship.
That would be in a month or two. But she never said it would be with me explicitly.

I think she'll try again if she makes up her mind. 
I haven't blocked her or anything."
kvkt6el,Opening-Lychee-4195,1,,1710856090,depression, I say keep your mind open to it but don't be as willing to be there for her like before. She doesn't sound like she's manipulative just procrastinating. 
kvl5hj3,Powerd_by_rice,1,,1710860578,depression," Yeah.

kvicl8f,Mraka936,1,,1710807808,depression," Honestly? You've got it all down already. You're loving and respecting your child, helping without being too hands on and overbearing or being too hands off and distant. I'm sorry to hear your son is depressed, depression is a terrifying thing for the simple reason that it's tough to fight, in my opinion. Some people are scarred and traumatized and can't drown out their demons, and some simply grow hollow over time even though they might have what many consider a ""good"" life. Perhaps get your son a journal, one with a lock where he's safe to write down his thoughts without his privacy being breached. Personally that helped me get to the root of my issues, and that's a decent start. Perhaps depression doesn't ever leave and it just subsides for awhile, but having a journal that's essentially your cheat sheet or guide can help combat it on your darker days."

kvkshuh,Bibliophile1998,2,,1710855829,depression," I appreciate your thoughts.  He has had suicidal ideation on and off for the past year...and just found out that he took a handful of melatonin last week in the hopes he would not wake up.  Thankfully we have the family and professional support system; but it feels terrifying. Of course we have now ensured the melatonin is kept safely away (as we do with RX meds).  I love the journal idea.  I will chat with him about that and make sure he has a way to journal privately; for him it might be on his computer as his dysgraphia makes the physical act of writing rather unpleasant.  We outsource two of his classes, one of which is writing.  His teacher has been wonderful in welcoming him to tweak topic ideas each week to what might help him, and he has taken her up on that a little here and there.  She has been so affirming of his feelings and very supportive.  A proper journal where he can let it all out safely sounds ideal.  Thank you."
kvkrgr3,Bibliophile1998,1,,1710855429,depression," Thank you - this is my mantra for him, but it is hard when I worry I am not doing as deep with some school subjects as I should, or not teaching him ""life stuff"" as we did by this age with our older two.  I keep reminding myself his nervous system is in survival mode and we need to focus on the basics overall.  Yet I still have this guilt that I am failing him."

I have a whole gaming setup that I was so excited to start gaming on and I’ve touched it maybe 5 times in the last year. Used to play piano and sax, have them in my room and don’t touch it. I just jerk off because it’ll make me feel something for a while with the least amount of effort. I’d rather be distraught or enraged than apathetic. I’ve tried medications, they just worsen the apathy."

I don't know you, but I can understand what you're going through. I hope you can have an at least semi-nice day today"
kvfn97u,takenwasjohny,2,,1710773931,depression," I'm 22 now, but when I was 18, I tried to kill myself 4 times, that I can remember. I'm not trying to be the main character here or anything.

kvhfj7j,Wild-and-fre,1,,1710795803,depression, The only thing you can do is try to work on the issues you have. It’s not going to be overnight. It may take years and that’s OK! Pick one thing you want to work on and just try it. If you fail it’s ok you’re not losing anything you can only gain from it. I’ve always been an extrovert but don’t have many friends. It’s hard for everyone so try not to put yourself down. You’re projecting your own insecurities on others and thinking you’re not good enough (or at least that is what it seems like). You are good enough! Try to stay positive. I know it’s hard but I’m sure you will find a great friend.
kvfj981,vanerosa,5,,1710772467,depression, Ty x. I hope things get better for you and your depression goes away
kvimcgt,Lifeafterruin,1,,1710811577,depression, I went through this same scenario too. I didn’t know what to do. Depression from grief is a tough combo. All you can do is be there for them as much as they’ll let you. You can’t take it away and you can’t change it as much as you want the person to feel better. I was just thinking about this earlier wishing I could go back to the time my childrens mother lost her mom and just hold her. Just to tell her I understand you now.
kvinco0,ExtremePrivacy18,2,,1710811973,depression," Life goes on.. and I know this may seem such a rude saying to say to someone that suffers from grief of a lost one.. but it’s true.. but I simply can’t say such words to them since it will come out as insensitive.

It’s hard to let go of such things. 

I’ll be there for her.. and hopefully let time do it’s thing I guess.

Also, sorry for what you went through, and I hope you are doing better now."
kviobiz,Lifeafterruin,1,,1710812354,depression, I had that same mindset. But you’re right you can’t say it. Every major milestone she’s going to want her mom. Every bad day she needs someone to be there for her she’s going to want her mom. Every birthday. Every time it’s her mom’s birthday she will hurt. Every year on the day of her passing she will hurt. Her life is forever changed. I thought that she should find happiness in who she had still like me and the babies but even though she had us she was still without. Her mom.
kvion1c,ExtremePrivacy18,2,,1710812481,depression, I wish I could heal her un-healable pain…

kvie408,lonelycranberry,1,,1710808384,depression," Hey, I just want to say I hear you and I’m sorry you’re going through this. I was experiencing similar and enrolled myself in outpatient therapy where I’m on site during normal work hours. They provide group therapy (which was new to me and weirdly my favorite part), psychiatry, and therapy. They also are there as long as you need it. My program is for adults but I bet there are some that exist for teens or younger adults that could be hugely beneficial. This place has offered community and support where I felt I couldn’t ever have that with friends and family, as I felt like a burden. 

If you have insurance (state is usually accepted at these places) I’d look and see if any fall under your coverage. This made a world of difference for me with my depression and consequent substance use I started in order to cope. OD’s are no joke and my heart breaks for you. The kindness I’ve gotten from strangers who have lived so differently but so similarly to me is beyond my expectations. It’s easier to be open and real about your feelings to people who don’t love you as a friend or family member. You don’t want to disappoint them or scare them more but your feelings are still there. Maybe your therapist also has ideas.

This place isn’t clinical at all. It’s very relaxed. Non-religious but some people are. It doesn’t have to be a “grippy sock vacation” if you don’t want it to be."

kvjo8m3,Fluffy_Natural_6355,1,,1710831306,depression," I'm in a similar situation like you (social anxiety, depressive disorder with panic attacks and agoraphobia), so I know how you feel, as well as being judged by people for something I have little to none control over. 

I'd suggest you don't listen to other people's comments and seek professional help if you haven't done so. My illness took half my life because I waited too long to seek help, and I listened to other people's advice who did not know anything about my disorders and let alone living with them. It led me to be chronically depressed and suicidal, so I attempted to kms, and I almost died once. The more you wait to seek help, the worse it is with time. That's why my progress is little and slow.

What I've learned when it comes to anxiety and panic attacks over the years is that you have to stop fighting it and feel it. The more you fight it, the worse it is. Easier said than done. Also, being around animals helps with mental disorders. Horses are good for people with anxiety as well as fish. Dogs and cats help with depression. I have a dog, and she helped me fight depression and agoraphobia so far.

And now we come to your question ""How to ask for help?"" Like I've said, only professional can help you because what I've read from your post, your family isn't supportive. And even if they were, this is something you have to fight, and there is little they can do besides showing support."

You're striving to be better and harshly criticize your flaws, and that level of awareness and desire to improve is admirable if a bit misplaced. Often when we are lovestruck we tend to be overly harsh about ourselves all for the sake of others. Be kind to yourself, not for the sake of someone you like and worry they might not reciprocate, but because you deserve to be treated fairly. Be careful of love, it's a beautiful thing but you also have to understand it as well, to study it. Do you love this person or just their looks? Is it just a rush of emotions based on your age and circumstance? Is it love or are you just so deprived of kindness that being treated decently like a human should be is enough to get you infatuated?

My life is perfect on paper. The fault of these feelings are only mine. I’m the only bad guy in this story. Just adds another layer of guilt to be honest.
I’ve never thought about someone not deserving me, and i never will. I just don’t work like that. Making other people happy is the only thing i care about, and that’s everything I want to care about. It’s all i live for. I don’t want them to ever have to worry about me.
Thank you for the response."

kvj9igm,Mediocre_Yacob,2,,1710821770,depression," Reading this, it sounds like you're well aware. Now I don't know the extent of the use, or what drugs. But I do know that usage can change people. I've watched many of my friends destroy their lives because of drugs. Some are living normal lives now, some still make the same dumb choices, others have passed away. 

Focusing on yourself is important, and while you move on from your friends, try and keep an eye on those of them that start to make better choices with you. Those are the keepers. Goodluck mate"

kvfiryn,Chard_Emotional,2,,1710772285,depression," Hey OP. I think it's very interesting hear about different cultures and how different people may be viewed in this world. I wanted to say that as a younger person i'm only 20 myself I understand being really self conscious about yourself and I imagine how tough others views may be from other backgrounds, but you shouldn't feel so upset what others think. easier said than done I know. I just noticed that being young feeling this way is pretty normal. graduating school it was really hard finding myself and what I want to do and I felt like I wasted my parent time and money and resources. I'm a first year now in college and I felt like that before and sometimes I still do but with time I feel like it can get better because nothing will be the same. what i will say is be easy on yourself, you have your whole life and the fact that you notice these things about yourself, like you talking about being depressed, you caught onto it very young compared to a lot of people I see that may be older. Just be kind to yourself, set goals, small to start just anything to keep you productive in life. Life is a classroom and we make mistakes but it's about how we finish at the end of the day. try talking about how you feel more with other you know as well in IRL that can help also. Nobody should feel alone, be safe and have a nice day and if you need anything just reply back"
kvg9eau,Revolutionary_Egg574,2,,1710781621,depression," hi love, thank u so much. & yes I absolutely need to work on not caring what others think abt me lol. I just feel like caring so much has made me this unproductive, self destructive person who literally can’t do anything and I give up so easily. I don’t like who I am anymore and I don’t know how to change myself. & I’m still so young so I know this is prob just a phase. thank u for ur kind words xx"
kvgayrd,Chard_Emotional,1,,1710782159,depression," Yea, it’s really crazy to think how distant we can be from our selfs because of others. I think social media and online culture has also ruined how people view themselves. For me personally things that I changed that helped me not care as much because I care what people think to an extent i obviously don’t want negative views on me but as in thing I can’t change about myself or that are out of my control. I enjoyed hiking around looking at how beautiful the world around us is and enjoying the moment I’m in, I listen to audiobooks, reading, trying new things out I’ve never thought about doing. Keeping a productive day and schedule and a routine even if it’s small or minimal is better than not doing much. I think you’ve got this, just seems like you’re confused about life and finding purpose with yourself and that’s normal life’s confusing and hard but you create your reality being positive will have a positive affect on your reality. Friendships, relationships, views on life will be better compared to negative where you’re in this box almost and nothing changes and it gets extremely exhausting after a while."

kveq54o,MrStyles18,2,,1710758539,depression, I am 30 but what you shared about young people being triggering for you. I myself go through that its hard to explain but its excurating pain just even looking at them my anxiety gets really bad i try to ignore & not look at anyone in public.
kvfxc02,Boot-Representative,2,,1710777494,depression," They say to find distractions and things like that. So I record music. But then I started trying to organize shows and gatherings about other topics. I have been trying harder and being more proactive. Many dating sites. A radio show. 

I’m not boring. I’m witty, funny, and intellectual. But the world is like a high school bully that just laughs when you try to hit back. And no one really cares if you win, as long as you don’t. 

And I’m old. I think it’s because of an apathetic parental relationship. I was the last child of my father and my mother. They were both very old. So even when I was married, family was not something I was good at. I’m 59. If my father was alive he’d be 112. 

And the guilt. I’m not poor and I’m not struggling and so so so so so many people have it worse. And more guilt. 

I only function at my best when I am in crisis. Constantly worried about money. I’m grateful to anyone trying to understand how guilty I feel."
kvgmn0r,HollowPretender,2,,1710786076,depression," Im sorry to hear you had a sad day, i kinda see what your goin through and i worry over this with my own father, i work alot and dont see him much and when im not working i try to spend all my time with him because well i have bad depression and two hes all i got in this world, i can see how hard it can be not having anyone around to talk to or hangout. But im sure if you get out and maybe take up a hobby of sorts you could meet people who have similar interests and maybe have a few new friends. Hope it gets better for you man"

kvjazdv,Sea_Abbreviations416,1,,1710822566,depression," Going on Paxil and lowering my dosage on it was absolutely terrible, had such bad nausea and sweating, honestly only thing I’ve noticed that works is time, gravel (taken in the morning so I can sleep off the drowsiness) and sometimes weed (legal where I live). I’d recommend a very very slow decrease on it and then start a different ssri I believe there’s about 3-5 different types you could look into, the other recommendation is to get medication to help manage the withdrawal symptoms while he comes off of it, I haven’t done too much research into those meds so I’d recommend starting there and focus on eliminating the worst symptoms for example a sleep medication to help with insomnia. Also speaking from experience of someone who’s been on plenty of medications and dealt with a lot of side effects I would gladly take all of those over the extreme nausea I had. :/ hope this helps a little, and try and look at the positives, glad that something helped with the depression!"

kvetpaz,,3,,1710760791,depression," Your parents destroyed your relationship with your parents. Just keep going to school, keep trying and if possible make yourself numb to negativity. Wait till you are old enough. Then once you are in college in a different city, you will finally have freedom and peace to take your life the way you see fit. Yes school and grades are important, but don't let others narrow your perspective to the extent where you think your life is ending. Life is a lot more struggle than just grades and the struggle never ends. Your parents may mean well. They love you and all, but sometimes love is toxic and you need some distance and time to heal from the poison of it all."

kvho5ce,moody_starboy,1,,1710798773,depression," I'm sorry to hear you are going through this .I totally relate, though. I just want to stay in bed all the time. Have you sought any professional help at all? It might be something to consider. I also find sometimes taking very small steps can help. For instance, instead of staying in bed, you could move to the couch and sit upright for a while. Or sit outside in the sunlight for a bit. It's not easy, but when you're depressed the small things can make a difference sometimes. Wishing you well\~"

kvg2949,Exact_Comparison93,1,,1710779200,depression, Sounds like you need someone to talk to and be understood by. Might not help a great deal but may take a bit of the pressure off
kvgwtqo,VenusLoveaka,1,,1710789506,depression," I understand. My sibling has a lot of anger because no matter how much we tried to get things together, we got rejected by life. Also went through the childhood trauma, except we didn't have a good 20s years (or at least I didn't).  I did enjoy college, though.  

The best part about kids is they do grow up eventually.  Not sure what level of special needs your kid has, but as they age the situation does get better as they mature. I worked with special needs kids for years as an educator. In the early years, I know they can be tough. But eventually as they age they can be productive and maybe even useful to your life.  Even ones that are nonverbal and with severe mental delays do tame with age.

A lot of people don't realize that post partum depression affects people, mothers and fathers alike.  It comes with anger, bitterness, regret, depression. I can only hope that things get better from here for you."
kvirbkx,SkyPieGuy,1,,1710813543,depression," I do think you should definitely tell those close to you about how you are feeling. Don't bottle it all up. It's okay, many people go through this type of thing, you're not alone. Please don't hurt yourself, you are worth so much. It's okay to seek help, and you aren't bad at all for wanting to seek help. You don't have to be dealing with this by yourself. Let it be known to whoever you feel comfortable with, like family, friends or a professional. I'm hoping the absolute best for you. Please be safe, you are worth it."
kvisju2,TheRealNapkin_,1,,1710814035,depression, Appreciate it. I just want everyone to treat me the same and I feel like partially the reason I won’t tell anyone
kvgya01,,1,,1710789989,depression, That's tough dude. Hearing your mom say that. Do you have any friends to talk to? You need to surround yourself with people who appreciate your presence. Is that possible?
kvhm2g2,FalwIII,2,,1710798046,depression, I think you're doing everything right in your situation. I wouldn't be able to think of any advise or ideas for bettering yourself that you aren't doing. About the girl I personally am not really sure. Maybe think about how would you tolerate a possible break up or something like that. I don't think that you would have any bad impact on her but you should speak about your problems. I think you should try if you can handle it but honestly I'm not qualified or anything to give advise like this. I think you're doing really good and your progress is huge

kvesy5a,,1,,1710760328,depression," You may be feeling insecure about who you are, since you mention your personality. Have you tried personality tests? I know it doesn't seem scientific but mbti helps understand yourself better. You sound like an INTJ personality. Once you are secure in who you are, find like minded individuals. There are many out there who well.. dislike social interaction. It's a disadvantage for sure. But you can rest assured knowing that you have a personality that you can understand and hopefully others can accept you for it. It may make it easier for you to accept yourself."

kvid5p5,Illusion-Eye,0,,1710808026,depression," Idk, you don't sound that bad to me. are you writing this from a high security prison? If not, then chin up, get a dating app, and go to a nice place with someone, preferably a comedy bar or something positive. try to just experience things as they unfold, don't react, just observe. If criticism of the world and high expectations from other people are your issues, you're pretty much in luck as I see it...some dragon from a game once told me ""it's wise to acknowledge when you only have one choice"" as I see it, the only choice is giving up on control desires.

In short- you'll have to always manta to yourself ""the higher the expectations, the bigger the disappointment"" all the time. Realize that you're the one steering your own boat, and steering away from something is always an option. You cannot steer another's boat, even if the change in course will be beneficial for them, even to avoid a potential collision with your boat. In all cases, steer yourself to a course that is clear of anyone else...so you won't have to worry about their steering. Hope this is clear enough.

Feeling the darkness of rock bottom is a part of starting to want to climb up and be better, if that's where you are feeling in, you're already half way into the process of being a different person. 
If you haven't committed any crimes, done anything dishonorable, or if any guilty nature, you're not evil. You shouldn't be beating yourself up like that, I'm sure there's a lot of good in you that is not mentioned here."

kvd87br,n_r_1995,20,,1710725244,depression," You should start practicing more self-compassion. I know it is easier said than done but these days there are a lot of online resources that can help you with it. Try going into therapy, and building friendships. Even a couple may be just enough in the beginning. 

Another much harder thing is to maybe consider leaving your boyfriend if he does not care. I don't know your relationship dynamics but it is difficult to improve if you are stuck in a toxic environment and feel like you aren't supported. 

It is not easy but the ideas are relatively simple. Be a light to yourself!"

kvdkxh2,BrentD22,6,,1710730856,depression," I’m searching for hope too. One thing I know is this feeling will eventually pass. It might take a bit, it might take some work, but this will pass. I’m 45… this is my 3rd bout of major depression. First was 16-18 years old, second was 26-27, and now 45 going through it again. The last 2 times felt as if I was never going to be ok again. It did end, I did get better, and during the good times I made a massive positive difference in the world and within my family. I’m not bragging about that part, I’m just presenting you with the concept that even now I am having a hard time finding hope. I rely on the fact that I climbed out of this twice and I can do it again. 

You can too."

They might lift you up sometimes, but that's only because they know they'll be tearing you down again later, they get off on having the ability to create such intense emotions in somebody else. And even moreso when they can repeat the cycle with the same person over and over, it gives them a sense of power like they own you.

It's so hard because not only do I feel the depression, I also feel guilt and resentment (and guilt about the resentment) about my family preventing me from doing what I think will bring relief.

I don't have any good advice, I'm caught right in the middle of it too, but I can tell you that you're not alone and that your feelings are completely normal and natural and even though they don't feel like it, they're coming from a place of love."

you truly deserve to be happy, I’m sorry you’re going through this, you’ve now got us guys okay 👍🏼

I think the first step is being kind to yourself and learning to love yourself, there’s a lot to love we can all tell from this message.

Have you tried any therapy or counselling? It might help just to talk to someone face to face and help you see the love inside you.

If the people in your life don’t love you then pardon my French but FUCK them, you’ve got a little person who loves you and you love her, you will realise this and then you will rise, just focus, love ,believe and it’ll happen.

YOU’VE GOT THIS! ❤️❤️❤️"

kvicuuv,averageaveraging,2,,1710807910,depression," Hey there, I know a lot of people who felt this way at 18. Now we’re all in our late 20s and I see lots of people have completely reinvented themselves and are doing more things they like, away from old friends and family. I’m not friends with all of them still, but I see lots of them on social media just doing things I completely didn’t expect and they seem much more grounded in themselves. Sometimes you just need time and space for yourself. And I’m happy for them even though we don’t keep in touch. You might have some silent supports too. I also want to say school is not for everyone and you don’t have to keep friends from there if they’re not for you.

 I did the standard high school -> university -> job and I really think I’m much less happy that my brother who didn’t go to the regular university route. instead did practical courses in things he enjoys and now he both teaches music and produces music. He makes enough to support himself and really gets so much fulfilment from his work. 

I hope you give yourself some grace to find your footing in the world before deciding to give up."

kvgj5tg,l0stk1tten,2,,1710784900,depression," Oh OP, seeing posts like this break my heart because my own father has depression. When I was diagnosed too, he started crying saying it was all his fault and he feels like he's given me the worst curse known to mankind. But I actually credit it to being bullied in school. He is the best father imaginable and best husband to my mother. He still has depression but doesn't hurt any of us with his actions. Went inpatient for a while when us kids were small but it didn't do us any harm. When he feels bad he's frank about it and goes to his room. At the end of the day his depression only hurts him. It's sad to see him sad but it's not doing huge damage to any of us. I have literally 0 negative memories growing up of him being depressed or anything (kids are usually pretty clueless too). If dad was sad that was just how it was, he was human. We have a bad family history too but 🤷‍♀️ you also have to remember that the world will keep seeing more and more advancements in health and technology.

People with depression tend to have a lot of love to give and I can tell from your post that you do too. Don't give up on it. I know what it's like to feel you have so much affection and care that you want to share but nowhere to put it :( but you can't erase that part of yourself and it's only natural to crave these things because it's ultimately good for you."

kvg45w8,kcee4840,1,,1710779852,depression, Personally I think reaching out for help is always the best option but I know it’s hard and sometimes you can’t just make sure your being safe it’s not worth putting yourself through serious pain or permanent injury over a mindset especially because in a day or a month or year or whatever it may be your mindset might change
kvg4u0s,thedamagedphoenix,1,,1710780078,depression," I know if it was a friend of mine that felt this way I would advise reaching out whenever they felt like this but my friends and loved ones have been so good and I don't want to feel like a burden by reaching out too much. I know that's a ridiculous thing to say or feel but I really can't help feeling that I don't deserve their love at times.

kvcsahc,Opening-Lychee-4195,4,,1710718696,depression, Depression effects everyone differently so it's a little insensitive and downright narcissistic of your mother to talk about herself when the topic is your problems. I can somewhat relate with you as I also was let go by my job and it was because of my own actions driven by my Depression. If you're having a hard time leaving your house you can either spend your time indoors but you absolutely MUST have conversations with people through things like gaming. You can keep in touch with friends that way or make new friends. Or you can do what i do and that's go to the gym to get in shape. The way I see it if I'm doing something that improves my physical health and makes me feel better about myself that translates to mental health. I know working out isn't for everyone as I myself was 292 pounds so that should tell you how bad I was. The choice is yours

I have no friends and no family anywhere close (distance wise) not that it would make much difference. Every single person in my very small circle is as sick of me as I am. I feel completely and utterly hopeless 27/4. It’s torture. I’m 67F with a completed medical history which explains my isolation. No one understands how crippling my panic attacks and my deep, deep depression is. I have been both physically AND mentally unwell for .

kvfuiwg,Property_Icy,1,,1710776523,depression," It's always good to see a counselor or Doctor. I'd get some bloodwork done to be sure you are not vitamin D3 deficient. Also could you suffer from Seasonal affect disorder? Feel depressed more in winter when there is less light? A lot of junk food can affect moods too. Does your exercise level change? Be careful of just going for anti depressants because they can have
 Side effects like flat affect and a sort of blah feeling. That was my experience after six years of taking them. I gained weight and lost my passion for the things I was interested in. I wasn't depressed but just didn't have any drive. Also if you are female PMS can be a factor. There are alot of physical things to examine that you can change. 18 is a rough time of life though😊much encouragement to you!"
kvhddb1,Chiel2909,1,,1710795074,depression," Of course I don't know what the options are for you, but just use any resource you can and are interested in.
Where I live a therapist is basically free if your general practitioner thinks your problems are ""valid"" enough for professional help. If that's the same for you I can tell you from experience it's definitely worth getting help.

Everyone deserves help whenever they think they need it, so do you.

The moment I realised I needed help with my depression was when I noticed how much self-sabotage I commit on myself. Despite happiness coming every now and then out of nowhere, I simply can't allow myself to feel happy, so whenever I do it must be stopped. It's a huge problem for me as it halts me from going forward in life. Now that I had that realisation I decided to visit my general practitioner and ask to go back to my previous therapist (I went there for a different issue before). I'm starting soon and honestly I'm quite excited to become a better version of myself, hopefully less (possibly un-) depressed.

It's worth it seeking whatever help you think will help you.

Edit: by the way, you're 18, your parents definitely don't have to know if you don't want them to."
kvi55st,SheepDavis,1,,1710804993,depression," I've been really deliberating seeking help from a therapist or psychiatrist, which will undoubtedly lead to a hospital visit. I've been on a bad cycle of self harm for years and it's really amped up this year. I know I am deeply depressed, but I would at least like to know if I am bipolar, schizophrenic, etc."
kvg5ur5,Standard-Elk2982,1,,1710780421,depression," Also, if you give me your college name I can also try to steer you in the right location. I'm a 32 year old female, when I was your age in college I felt very similar except I already had my diagnosis(s). I also had to take a semester off for a debilitating eating disorder. All of which the doctors, therapist and my department helped me with. It feels insurmountable but it's not, especially at your age. Please, take advantage of the resources. I'm in NC and went to UNCG and UNCC. Again, if you tell me your college I can try to help. Sometimes being depressed makes all of this much harder, sometimes it's easier if someone helps you, sometimes it's easier if someone makes the first step with you."

I struggle with this too. I have never felt like someone's priority but have made others my priority.  A hard part is learning how to balance this too, when you do learn to love yourself, keeping yourself open enough to allowing yourself to love others and allowing them to love you too all while still remembering to love yourself.

Work on loving yourself for now. You deserve to be loved. It will come with time. I know it's hard but make yourself your priority and things will come naturally. It makes it a lot more wonderful when you love yourself and find that love"

Ever since I was about 14 I've been desperate for someone to love me romantically and ended up in some dangerous situations because of that. I have no long term friends and I've never had a long term relationship, I'm approaching my 30's. I feel hopeless and it's painful, I ended up stopping contact with my dad because I couldn't handle feeling uncared for anymore. I am lucky to have my mum but the rest of my family probably wouldn't even notice if I died, they don't love me or even acknowledge me. I also can't remember my childhood, and personally I don't really know why but there's barely any memories there.

k7c19oc,SufficientRead_,2,,1698819678,depression," I feel the same way, although my family has loved me, but the feeling that you're not someone's first choice is devastating.

And the safe space thing, you'll get there don't beat yourself up. The fact that you're here is that you've started realizing whats missing and you'll now work on it.

But most importantly, they will accept you, want the best for you, they’ll challenge you in healthy ways, and they will pull you up when you’re truly down.
But you’re right, you shouldn’t have to beg people to love you. If you have to beg they don’t deserve your time. Love was in short supply when I was a child, I understand feeling robbed of basic things other people just had all the time, but we aren’t alone.

This was a life changing line from my therapist.

I went from having severe depression to pretty livable depression now. I can definitely say I am happy. Just my brain is still messed up and not producing the happy chemicals like it should.

I used to think relationships was the only way to validate oneself. To feel worthy.  My therapist taught me self kindness, confidence, and that it's okay to even be a little bit selfish (within reason) for myself.

My life changed so much for the better all because of that one line ""The person that should give you the most love is you."""

libido aside, these kind of meds give me way too many side effects that end up making me less functional and more miserable, so unless wellbutrin is legalized where i live, i'm not coming back to this shit. and yes, i feel like many mental health professionals underestimate how badly antidepressant-induced sex drive issues can affect your mood and life quality."

I would honestly recommend checking out a dentist sub if you haven’t already or something in that alleyway as well.

For example, when I was young, my 6th grade teacher told the whole class, “if someone makes fun of you, just take it as a compliment.” I was pretty weird back then, so I kind ended up using his advice a few times.

kw0q6w4,TechnicalAd8103,1,,1711098286,depression," You need to go to the dentist. From what you are describing, your teeth are in such a bad state that you may not have many teeth left in 5 years. It would be very unprofessional for any dentist or dental hygienist to laugh at your teeth, but even if they do, 2 hours of their laughing is worth getting your teeth examined.

If you cost is an issue, dental schools and dental hygienist schools offer a range of very cheap dental services, which are carried out by dental students, but they are supervised by a professional dentist. The processes may take longer than normal, because the students need to sometimes ask their supervisor for help or assistance. These aren't first year students, they're usually third or final year students with lots of practical experience.

Check the websites of dental schools near you. All the best. 👍"

Never commit suicide, I cant say theres a god i believe in it because of reasons but from an objective point of view, the universe's law or physics or probablity will always solve ANY issue. Please dont take that step and as awful as this sounds, WHEN not if (I just dont know when,when is) you get out of it, you will be able to endure anything life throws at you it is kind of like a sick gift but a gift to toughen you up.

It's the mental illness talking. They actually don't all hate us. Took me several breaking-points to make it to this conclusion and it hurt every step of the way, but being able to tell that to yourself is a big deal and something you should get help with working on.

Please check into a hospital. They can't knock your credit for it, if you're worrying about money. Debt while mentally well is damn near infinitely better than this place you're in and have clearly been in for a long time.

That could help you. Typically SSRIs are more likely to cause sexual problems. But I'm on a newer SSRI, vortioxetine, which delays orgasm a bit but it's not a big deal.

I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "

The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

1bhuj8n,Wrastling97,303,16.0,1710778286,happy,"My life has completely changed for the better  This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying).

But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me.

I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years.

This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up.

1b9xvs5,pfemme2,121,14.0,1709928643,happy,"Due to fear of the dentist and the pandemic, I put off going ever since the pandemic began. Today I just got the final crown put in of a huge amount of work I needed to get done. The shadow in the back of my mind has been lifted. When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "

I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic.

I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.

That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"".

And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"

The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies.

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.

1b14bvm,ilyalit,80,4.0,1709012706,happy,"Partner surprised a Habitat for Humanity family with great news 2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "

To start, I am a swimming teacher who works with young children. Lots of the kiddos who are put into my classes have special needs of some sort. I'm not exactly sure why, but I do have some experience working with special needs children, so I think I handle the groups fairly well. I know I'm not sharing anything groundbreaking, but I finally got to feel like I'm serving my purpose.

I had the mother of a little girl approach me yesterday. It was our last session together (I teach group lessons, and they run for eleven weeks). She asked if there was any way to make sure that her daughter could be in my class again next time.

This just made me feel like I was special in some way that helped this kiddo

 Over the weeks kids really come out of their shells, and this girl in particular had gone from being quiet as a mouse to bobbing around like a giggly little goldfish. I think she probably has ASD, and it always makes me so happy to see my ASD kids come out of their shells. I was one of those kids, and really remember how some of my swim instructors had such a huge impact on me.

This is a lot of words just to say that I think I've found a purpose. I know I can't teach lessons for much longer, as I go away to college soon, but I feel so blessed to have helped at least one kid. To know that another kid like me maybe found something they love. I don't know how to describe it, but hearing her mom say that to me kind of broke my heart in a good way. I feel so appreciated and happy. That's all :)"

I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "

I know this sounds so silly but I F18 and finally had the epiphany of how important school, college and university is.
 
The majority of people in my area aren’t taught this in school therefore others my age drop out of college, do boring 9-5 jobs and don’t see the importance of their education.

Luckily I go to a college closer to the capital city of my country where everyone has a better work ethic, than the locals I’ve been influenced by. 

I used to be so confused as to my my peers would be so motivated to go to class everyday, work hard, revise for exams etc, usually I would skip class, stay home, not revise.
Until I realised the importance of how these few years of education, trial and error and putting in your best actually shape your entire life! 

I was reading up on the entry requirements for the courses I’d want to do in uni and never realised you’d actually need good grades, and a college degree etc.

I know I seem silly for only realising all of this now, but I’m actually feeling very hopeful for my future and I’m looking forward to it.
I haven’t felt like this before and hope this post can help more less educated people like me! Better late than never! 💛💛"

I felt kind of hopeless and without energy, scrolling through tiktok for 3 days. I felt like my brain just couldn't function.

  But tonight I had an amazing dream. I was with a friend on the subway, she was doing to Santa Catarina, In Brazil, because she has family there, her mother's side. We were chatting about it. In the dream I supposedly wanted that exchange program that she got, but felt happy that she got it, because her family is Brazilian. For context I love my friend but I sometimes feel envy towards her, even though I don't want to feel it, so I felt happy that I felt happy for her.

 Then she got off the subway. I watched her walk off, the breeze was nice and it was sunny. I was smiling wide and then I noticed my smile in the reflexion of the window and kept smiling. I woke up after this.

  I know it may sound silly but it made me really happy to have that special moment, even if it was in a dream."
1atzpz8,ProofAdhesiveness652,221,14.0,1708277920,happy,"Wanna hear the one sentence my dad said that made me misty eyed? “How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."

1attgzh,Old-Series-7367,41,4.0,1708260915,happy,"I can confidently say that I am comfortable in my own skin!!  For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about.

1aswe2k,sricool,30,2.0,1708155279,happy,"Destined Hearts: A Journey of Love from Online Connection to Real-Life Happiness💜 We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."

The 3 years I’ve lived in my apartment I’ve had my eyes on this amazingly gorgeous woman. I’ve watched suitors come and go and I’ve dealt with my emotions in that regard.

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."

I didn’t even interview, she said she knew she wanted to hire me for the position which shocked me as it was not the position I originally applied for. I know I won’t get paid right away but it’s something my landlord (hopefully) will work with. I haven’t had any money coming into this home for the last 3 months and to start working in a field I have been wanting to be in, brings tears to my eyes. 

I hope this is long enough and fleshed out more so it won’t get flagged. I NEVER post things that are private but with this win I feel like maybe I should start sharing with the world a bit more. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. "

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."

He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby.

That doesn't sound that great, ***right?*** SO I PLUGGED IN MY USB TO REFORMAT IT AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE??????????????

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."

1ap9iro,booshieboosh,86,6.0,1707768460,happy,"I was feeling particularly shitty tonight and my girlfriend made me feel things I've never felt before So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."

I never believed in love from first sight, I always believed that love need time and effort to build, after years of trying I started to believe that maybe I'm not worthy of love, maybe my feelings are too much, maybe I'm delusional that the love I want doesn't exist. I hope this story will encourage someone to follow their heart.

I was on a trip by myself ( few months after being ghosted by my ex bf ) last day of my vacation I wanted some company so I downloaded tender and asked a guy who seemed not talkative at all if he wants some coffee, he said ""ok 10 min"" , to my surprise he showed up in exactly 10 min, we had a walk trying to find coffee at 11 pm, didn't find any so we got 2 bottles of water found a seat outside a store and started talking about our day, telling each other funny random stories, we're from different countries ( english is not our first language ) so we used google translate most of the time. we ended the date in an hour or so, I was feeling so weird, I felt like I just met my best friend it felt so warm and comfortable. same night I texted him again if he wants to come over, and it was the best day of our lives, we stayed up for a whole day talking laughing we went to the beach got matching bracelets then I had to go back to my real life..

he visited me couple days after, I know it's crazy but I asked him to be my bf on the second date and he said yes that he was as crazy and wanted to ask me the same. after a week we decided we want to stay together, like forever, so why not just get married? I left my job, he met my family, got in engaged and our wedding day finished some nightmare paperwork, and got married 3 months from the first time we met.

it's been 8 months now, it wasn't all butterflies, we had so many arguments, we went through very difficult times, but every day we get to love each other more.

I still can't believe I'm getting this much love, that someone accepts me for who I am and love everything about me. lots of times I struggle with my insecurities and fears, but he hugs me and it all disappears, and every single time we hug it feels magically beautiful.

I'm glad I followed my heart, I'm glad I wasn't embarrassed of how fast I fell in love, that I didn't hesitate when my friends called me crazy. 

for people who think about safety, you're totally right, safety comes first. I was very awake to the details on the first date + this happened in my country + he respected my space which made me feel safe and comfortable."

Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "

I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."

To start off, im on mobile so excuse me if this is all over the place. I have known my boyfriend for a little over a year. I’ve always found the concept of “love at first sight” ridiculous, but let me tell you, something about him just kept reeling me in the moment i’ve laid eyes on him. We’ve had a very rocky relationship (more of a situationship for the most part), a lot of mistakes were made. We’ve hurt each other so many times, we kept trying to cut contact but we both just couldn’t stay away from each other. When we finally re-united for the last time this summer, we had a very open and honest conversation about everything that happened so far. Since then everything has just been perfect. I cannot tell you how perfect this man is. Of course we still have arguments or tense moments, but overall everyday of my life feels like the best day when he’s by my side. I would’ve never imagined that i would love another human being this much. He is the kindest, the most thoughtful soul i’ve ever met. I must admit, i can be a very childish and difficult person sometimes, however he is so so patient with me… More patient than i am with myself. I love him, i love him so much that it pours out of me. It pours on the way i view life, the way i view myself, onto my friends and family, onto strangers i cross paths with, onto everything. He makes everything so much better. I do not know if this is how love is or if it’s unhealthy, but i do know that i am so very greatful to have him in my life. I felt i had to share this to get it out of my chest, thank you if you’ve read all of this yappin’. 🫶🏻"

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."

I am recovering from Postpartum mood disorder, it manifested as anxiety, and I had 'baby brain' which I didn't understand until I started to regain the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Today I remembered to do the things I set myself as tasks just as I was falling asleep last night. I have difficulty falling asleep, I often lay awake for 2 hours, just random thoughts, and often remember things I've forgotten to do and make myself mental to do list which I then regularly forget. Such as put pen and paper on bedside table to write down the to do list. (No phone near bed) Anyways, last night I remembered that I had forgotten to reply to an email I received a week ago, and today I replied, first little win. I also remembered I had to email stationery shop to get them to print a document for me, and I also remembered to go to the stationery shop to collect the print out. Double little win.

The biggest little win for me today was answering phone call that I felt was going to be awkward conversation, phone rang, I looked at display, realised it was awkward conversation, felt dread, thought about ignoring it and letting it ring out, but I answered, had the awkward conversation, and then it was done, finished, no more dread. Little win.

It doesn't sound like much I know, but to me it's a day of wins.

4 years ago I had a shopping bag full of unopened letters, that I was hiding because I didn't know what to do with them. Nothing scary in them, usual household bills, statements, renewal information, nothing that today I couldn't handle. But 4 years ago, it felt impossible. Postman would bring letters, I took them out of post box, and then stuffed them in shopping bag I hid in garage. Why? I don't know exactly. If I opened a letter I would then have to 'deal with it', whatever it was, and in my Postpartum mood I couldn't. The thought of opening envelope, then reading contents, then making decision to file document, go to home office room, go to bookcase, find appropriate folder, find hole punch, place document in folder, well, that was just impossible to accomplish. And that was for simple notification letter. What if it was a letter I had to do something with? Car insurance renewal? No way. Couldn't handle that. Ringing around to get quotes, comparing policies, nope, couldn't do it. Just hide the letters.

Today I can open letters. It's taken a long time to get here, I did it and I'm celebrating the little wins. If you understand, wonderful."

I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

1ag446e,StudentMafia2002,35,4.0,1706767346,happy,"Parents are emotionally becoming more aware and it is helping me massively with my mental health 
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."

So the guy went back and picked him up and put him on the road and then the puppy walked after him with a big waggy tail.

The step off the curb was too high!! 🥹

🎈3 hot air balloons coming into land nearby. I saw about 5 in the sky but there were 3 landing in a park along the trainline. They're huge! I've never seen that before!! It was very exciting for me!!

The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."

But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.

It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high.

I’m in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I’d gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines… no thanks!) I’d actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college’s tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he “wasn’t sure” and that I “still had time to call” when I asked him if I’d receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I’d started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+… I’ve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I’ll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don’t know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don’t have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed.

At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I’ve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I’m not sure how to process it. I’m incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I’m lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this? I don’t want to get burned out I want to be happy going to work when I’m 60"

So, I’m 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I’m done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don’t want kids, I’m a stoner, and I’d be content being single. However, if someone comes along that’s fine too. I’m very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I’m gonna find someone romantically, they’re gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I “wanted” in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, “I should live this way” instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, “In spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?” Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now. 

I’m much more happy and content with this plan. I hope I end up happy with it and the ways reality differs from my plan."

19fgxwv,Andtherainfelldown,10,3.0,1706209382,happy,"I found a quarter today and other Friday Eve Miracles …. Friday Eve, the middle of the week. So far enough away from Monday and so close to Saturday to make it one of the best days of the work week. Typically, today is quite a busy day for me. I have more than my fair share of students and with mixed grade levels, it can be a lot to handle. Plus, today is also the one day of the week that I also have a tutoring period. Which can vary anywhere from one to a dozen or so generally off task teenagers. Which makes for a difficult end to the day.

Yet today is a day of Friday Eve Miracles. I came into work and half my students are not present due to grade level testing. Oh, the joys of not having a whole grade level to manage. It is a sigh of relief that only an educator can understand. 

To make things better, I got my tutoring list for the day and wouldn’t you know it is only one student. One student that I have a really good relationship with. That is a joy to be around, that generally cares and isn’t just taking up my space.

But there is more good things happening today. As I walked into my classroom for the first time I saw something shinny on the floor. Being the curious creature that I am, I went to investigate and found a quarter.

Oh the smile it brings to my face. I truly do not believe that the current generation of teenagers knows just how special a quarter is. But to those of us who grew up in a coin operated economy knows all the wonderful things that a quarter could bring to your life. When I was a child, finding a quarter meant I could play a video game or get a snack. I could take my chance at a surprise gift from a vending machine or even help my mom with laundry if I so desired to be generous.

And perhaps that is what really has made me smile this morning. Just a bit of nostalgia from a time when my life just seemed so much simpler. Finding a quarter as a child was a really big deal, again you could do a lot of things with a quarter. It may not do much now, but just the happiness I get when I find one now. I put it my pocket and then sporadically through out the day will feel around in my pocket to make sure I haven’t lost it. Because the number of things I have lost since my youth is to great, so I need to hold on to the little miracles that life gives me now. 

So now to you good reader. I ask you, what is one small miracle that you have experienced on this Thursday or as I like to call it Friday Eve :)"

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."

Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"

19d35q8,imaginarywaffleiron,427,18.0,1705949649,happy,"My brother and I had donuts delivered to our grandfather When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."

19dbvu7,GR33N4L1F3,16,3.0,1705971640,happy,"I moved 400+ miles away from my hometown and I virtually couldn’t be happier with my decision! Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."

19cbfas,SpaceBitchh,67,4.0,1705865282,happy,"My mom randomly gave me a mini frigidaire today My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

19ask4o,alinaesque,26,2.0,1705695328,happy,"My friend drew me with my favorite character after a rough day not knowing it made me tear up! For context there's this one character that I absolutely adore from an old book series I love, we'll call him H. I've known H for just a year and he has been the biggest comfort character out there. I relate to his character and his upbringing, and his own character has managed to actually make me realize more things of myself and grow as a person. I also even write fanfiction of him, which I feel like is average for a girl my age so I am not that embarrassed. I also of course have a deep crush on him which I joke of with my friends, calling H my boyfriend and such (secretly I actually love these jokes, though I'm too shy to admit that, haha). In other words, H is an amazing character and I am surprised he is not anywhere near mainstream! Though I am glad as I can keep him all to myself now, haha.

I was having a rough day that day, my period had started, my dad was pestering about me going to high school (for health reasons I'll never be able to attend one which upset me a lot), and I was stressing over a theme coding project I had been working on for two days as a gift for a friend. I finished the code early this day and was too scared of sending it to my friend because I deemed it 'aesthetically unpleasing'. In the end I did send it, and then immediately deleted it. But then I realized that I deleted it too late, as now my friend had the code file. The absolute panic I felt in that moment before he revealed to me that he actually liked it! But what I didn't expect was for him to send something back for me. The squeal I let out when I saw it one would think I had won a million dollars! :) It was a drawing of H and me! Let me tell you that my friend is probably one of the best artists I've ever known or seen, so to get a drawing was a blessing itself. But a personal one of my ultimate teen girl fantasy no matter how cringe it was? My heart clenched and I swear I started to feel tears bubbling up inside of me. I am still continuing on expressing my gratefulness to him hours later lol.

He didn't even have to do that for me, yet he did. I am so grateful of my best friend and I absolutely love him with all my heart. It's things like these that make me grateful of meeting him and also of other people in my life, and that I am not truly alone. I wish I realized sooner how much he has done for me. Each time I think about it my eyes brim up with emotional and absolute happy tears. I've been so used to gifts and presents that never truly fit my interests or were considerate enough, but he? He knows me too well to know how to make me the happiest girl in the world. We both jokingly call each other brothers from another mothers, but I realize that I genuinely see him as one, which is making me far too emotional too living as an only child and being the only teen in my family and relatives, so I never had a close relationship like that with someone around my age.

Lesson of the day (for me at least) is that you are never truly alone, and that there are people out there who will embrace any part of you, even your embarrassing fictional crushes. And to also tell my friends more that I love them. :)"

19ad5ly,IDivide_byZero,15,3.0,1705647707,happy,"Overcoming my own hurdles and finally felt like me in the longest time. Hi everyone. Sorry that this is quite long...I had this experience in December and typed out how I felt, but I never got around to posting it. I wanted to share what happened so I’m just putting this into the aether.

What is your personal background music to make a mundane action become an epic tale to overcome your own daily anxiety of existing? I had 2 upbeat songs that lightened up my soul (like “Hey, Soul Sister” and “Get Back” by THE one the THE only Luda!), and then 1 slow song to root me back down (I had the Mr.Kitty song “After Dark”), followed by another BANGER alert “Paint the Town Red” by Doja Cat... straight banger…anyways...and then something simply great. The first four weren’t necessarily in that order, but this song was last. The soul lifter “Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home”.

The mundane actions of vacuuming, cleaning, organizing, doing the dishes, emptying the cat bin, etc., all became the act of a Hero overcoming adversity. Showing that even those that only managed to shower today are at times doing their best…you even completing one of the many tasks that need to be done is inspirational and shows you are still pushing.

I must say though that I just chose my playlist of liked videos and put it on shuffle so these are songs I already liked but they made the day feel so much more personal because I connected them to being the best version of myself in that moment. I felt in sync with myself. I felt…happy.

I belted “HEY SOUL SISTA!” at the top of my lungs for my friends. I did some shit talk dancing while listening to motha’ fuckin Luda! I did some sensual hip wiggles while listening to “After Dark."" I felt so sassy during Doja...wagging my finger back and forth and bobbing my head.

I was even happier knowing that Amanda was out looking for a Christmas tree. I was listening to “Home” again when I thought that…what a beautiful song. We are moving forward in our lives and it's spectacular. We get to put ornaments and our tree topper up soon! The tree topper we use is my Beanie Baby Creepers. I got him when I was young and I started putting him up there in my early 20’s so it just kind of continued on.

Moving on though! Amazingly, I pushed myself further and completed the next mundane task…I ate food. That’s impressive if I must say so myself. Maybe not to some…but I did it. I deserve to eat. And right now I think THAT is impressive too. :)

I hope this makes sense... It felt like such a beautiful out of body moment for me and I want others to try to experience that perspective of just being themselves and that doing simple things is in of itself beautiful. If the simple things are hard at this point in time for you, please keep telling yourself that you can do hard things."

198by96,Shelbutter,1374,64.0,1705434404,happy,"I posted the last 2 years. I’m back for a third. (Keeping myself accountable haha more info in body text) Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal.

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m

Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

This is one of the greatest days of my life, bar none and I could not be happier or more proud! I think I’ve done really well.

I've been living bill to bill, rent to rent, month to month and sometimes had to borrow to meet the rent (since my pay is bi weekly).

I've been so bitter all year. Initially it hurt that I had to work and do my difficult stem course and worry about feeding myself while all my friends and classmates lived in their lavish apartments close to school as I commuted from far away to save money. But I don't feel bitter anymore!


I know what living month to month feels like so I'm gonna still do max hours of work. But I'm gonna be able to give myself 2 weeks of breaks between semesters now. 


I'm moving in with my boyfriend too which will reduce my rent by so much since we're splitting.

&#x200B;

I'm so happy. I hope no crisis will take away this safety net I have built. I hope that when my parents travel here I can pay for all of their needs. I'm just happy man. Fingers crossed!!

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

18xqvrj,Prudent_Jello5691,26,4.0,1704308288,happy,"Had a call centre job last summer which turned out to be surprisingly rewarding With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages"

The smaller one literally said “doctor, you’re so cute” (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said “thank you, bye, cute doctor”. Their dad just laughed at the whole thing but I feel like I have to credit good parenting. This has to be the most wholesome interaction."
18xqt4z,Prudent_Jello5691,13,1.0,1704308107,happy,"My old form tutor lost a family member, I orchestrated a card which she received very well A few years ago when I was in Year 13 (last year of high school in the UK) my form tutor didn't show up one day and it turned out she was having a family bereavement. She was very well liked and her family was all the way in New Zealand so it felt like we could hardly just do nothing.

I stepped up to the plate and bought a card, and somehow got it around the whole form class, plus a few people in the media class she took in our year as I recall, over the course of a few days without her knowing. The message I wrote in the card was ""don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened"", which was what I lived by when my Grandma died a couple of years later in 2022. 

The day comes to give it to her, and it turns out a few girls in the class have also bought her a box of chocolates, even better right? They hand her the chocolates, and I make my friend hand her the card because of my social anxiety. We thought she'd appreciate it, but we got more than we bargained for. She's clearly holding back tears and starts talking about how loved she felt and how lucky she was to be our form tutor.

This was during the few months of COVID where schools were open in the UK, so things were obviously really grim at the time. She was a really sweet, positive, glass half full person to be around and so form class with her was really the only thing keeping a lot of us going. Not only did the gifts have a good impact on her, but it felt like we'd paid her back a little as well."

Always has just been a complete lack of plans or everything falling through an hour before it’s supposed to happen, y’know. 

This year I saw to it for that to not be the case, which was an absolute success. I bought tickets to an underground rave in the city (Chi) with two of my buddies and ended up seeing multiple good friends who I hadn’t spoken to in years.

Midnight rolled in a few minutes after we had arrived n’ me and some friends danced til exhaustion multiple times over, being a fairly reserved person, that was something I’ve never done before; and I gotta say I enjoyed it thoroughly. The event was set to end at 3am but at 2:30 it was still going full bore.

Around that time I was just vibing with one of my buddies on the outer edge of the set, when I glanced behind me and a gal rEally caught my eye. Totally my type. 

Of course there were other girls there that I could’ve put some effort into to dance with and the likes, but she appeared at seemingly the perfect time. Thinking the rave would be done in the next 30 minutes, I took a moment to think about how I’d approach her. (I’ve never tried talking to a girl at any type of function before, school dances, any other parties I had been to, etc. never even bothered.) 

This probably shouldn’t have worked but it did. After mustering up some confidence, I offered my friend my vape, (I know, ew.) let him take a few hits, then turned around and offered it to her. She gladly accepted my offer, introduced herself as Annie, and we continued to talk (may or may not have found a room as well) until 5am. Got her number and social, got her an Uber (her group ditched her), and headed home with the boys. 

I’m just proud of myself and glad I had a genuinely “Happy New Year” this time around. 

I’m one to think that the starting of a new calendar year is nothing really special, and just another day. Because.. c’mon, it just is. But although today’s just another day, it sure is a good one for me.

P.S. - Came to find out at some point that Annie is short for Anastasia. Lord almighty good god she’s got a name as beautiful as her🫠"

18ufu5r,Purplethrowaway_,45,2.0,1703943488,happy,"I can feel the bottom of my feet again! The nerves fixed themselves 🥳 This morning I was walking around my apartment and my feet were cold from the tile floor. This was annoying until I realized that this meant my feet’s nerves were working again 🥳🥳🥳🥳. 

This is the first time this year it’s been cold where I live, so I’m not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn’t notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I’m tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there’s nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn’t think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they’re definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn’t just temperature I can feel 🥳🥳🥳

My feet now feel super tingly from the cold so I think they’re just having to readjust to being able to feel again or something but I’m so excited🥳🥳🥳"

You see, I like dressing up a lot and I still did it earlier. I tucked a red sweatshirt on a pink skirt and matched it with my pink heels and bag.

At the grocery store, a promoter of something asked me to take a picture with them, and I did! I was genuinely happy about that because someone noticed my style.

We went to another mall because the first store was a bit lacking. While I was looking for food containers to put my desserts in, a saleslady complimented my heels!

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"
18tocz6,Terrible_Name_387,56,9.0,1703860182,happy,"What is the best gift you gave to someone? I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."

18sx9a7,the_sexy_date,90,8.0,1703779263,happy,"i asked ai to remake one of my happiest days in my life. and it didn't disappoint me today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"

18sp2pp,HauntedHouse10273,36,5.0,1703752155,happy,"The two stray cats I took in are best friends now I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."

So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.

I was in a conference for women and there was one girl in particular that smiled often during the zoom call. She laughed and smiled and seemed to brighten the call. That day, we were sharing some things amongst our breakout rooms. I shared that her smile saved me in some ways. Or, at least that it showed me something. But, I know it really did save me. 

I was so low that the thought of someone smiling so freely shocked me. I didn’t realize that people were that happy. I cried while I shared that her smile truly did something for me.

I wonder if she knows how much that changed my perspective during that time. 

Now, I smile often. I smile at the small and big things. Although it may dim at times, I never knew I’d be at this place in my life. Looking back, I think I always kept a sour face so people would notice that I needed help. Now? I smile because it brings me happiness, because there are things to be happy about daily although it seems hard at times.

I think her smile made me smile more, at least partly. 


So just know, you will smile more in life. It takes time, but you will."
18pi35n,devilishlydo,123,9.0,1703374532,happy,"After a decade and a half of struggling financially after my career was derailed, I just got offered a state job that will put my career back on track and basically change my life Sad bit first: In 2008, I was an up and coming IT professional with a specialty of running help desks; but I lost my wife to a long-term illness and my job to the housing crisis. Since then, I've gotten by on telephone-based customer service jobs. It was tough when our kids were small; but once they grew up, I was able to live a modest life until inflation and student loans started to make things increasingly untenable. On top of that, I've been working overnight from home as an emergency dispatcher for an organization with far too limited resources and it's been isolating, demoralizing and just generally soul-draining. 

&#x200B;

Happy bit now: Back in May, a very close friend of mine who works for the state let me know about some jobs that would be coming up that paid really, really well by my new standards. What followed were months of drama involving resumes, paperwork, choosing the right government contractor to work for and being interviewed three separate times by the same two people and a different rotating guest interviewer every time. I was starting to lose all hope; but yesterday, I got an offer for the best of all possible positions. I'll not only be running the help desk; after a few years, I will \*be\* the help desk. The only other person working on the desk has been there since day one, but she retires in a few years and hasn't done a very good job of writing down how to do all of the things she does; while I've got years of experience documenting processes for my own job and for others. Anyway, aside from the need to document processes, the desk isn't very busy. It's the customer service help desk for a state web site used to track controlled substance prescriptions. Unless something significant changes, they'll probably never need more than one person to work on it. That means that, after a few years passes and my coworker retires, I'll have a government job that isn't very busy and will always exist in some form unless the government suddenly decides to stop tracking controlled substance prescriptions. Plus I'll still be able to work from home (but no longer on third shift) with a flexible schedule that will allow me to make appointments without taking time off, 11 paid holidays a year and all the folks I'll be working with and under are perfectly lovely by every account. And then there's the pay. By my math, I'll be making almost exactly twice what I make in my current job (from approx $35k to $70k in a state where about $47k is considered comfortable). And my life is already pretty dialed in for penny pinching that mostly won't change; so aside from some badly needed one-time expenses I've been putting off, most of the extra money will be discretionary. On top of that, I will very likely never be put in charge of anyone else unless I decide to go for another position. I have traditionally avoided management positions because I've so often worked in places where management meant a small increase in pay for a huge increase in stress, but that's not the case for state employees at all.

&#x200B;

In short, this job will change my life. For pretty much my whole life, I've been barely holding on financially. I don't even know how to live without worrying about money. Even now, it doesn't feel real that I've been this fortunate. I told my friend that I won't feel truly financially secure until I can set all of my bills to autopay but I really will be able to do that! After my final interview and the night before the final decision was made, I made a list of all of the things I'd buy if I got the job that I probably can't buy now. The list was made up almost entirely of things that I've been putting off; in some cases, for years. Even talking about it makes me think that I should feel all bummed out about that, but I'll be able to take care of all of that shit soon!

&#x200B;

Also, I'll get a state pension and be able to save up additional money to make up for lost time. I'm a veteran who goes to the VA for health care, so I won't have to worry about being bankrupted by medical bills as I get older or in the case of sudden illness. My only major debt is my student loans because they were my first major debt and I refused to borrow afterward, but I'll be able to make payments on those fairly easily now. In short, there is now nothing to prevent me from working until the retirement age of my choice and then retiring in relative comfort and dignity. This is a dramatic improvement over my previous plan, ie to work until the day I have a massive heart attack or until I get too old to work and find myself shuffled off to a VA raisin ranch to suffer in squalor or - worse yet - to end up becoming a drain on the kids. And speaking of the kids, they're grown now and they're getting by, but they're not exactly rolling in dough. One of them is working night jobs and going to college. The other is getting married (delayed due to the expense) and struggling under her first car loan (for a car that is a lemon, naturally). They've never really been able to depend on me financially since they got their own jobs and they've really never asked for help; but the fact that I'll finally be able open the Bank of Dad and take financial pressure off of them makes me happy beyond all measure. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR I got a new job and I feel amazing; like everything has changed for the better. I probably haven't even considered all of the implications. I mean, I still have problems, right?  Everyone has problems that can't be solved with money. So of course I still have some, right? Except ... I can't seem to think of any. Weird, right? Definitely a good kinda weird, though."

I’m the oldest of three, I have two little sisters. One is 18 and the other is 11. When I was in an abusive relationship, my ex had treated my sisters poorly, gave no interest in them, and at one time ignored my youngest sister. I should’ve seen the signs, I was young and stupid, and didn’t know what to do.

I’ve made it a rule in my relationships that my partner must respect my family, especially my sisters, as they are the most important people to me.

My boyfriend is a GOD SENT. First time meeting my youngest sister, he immediately showed interest in her favorite shows, bought her ice cream, laughed with her. She adores him, they will sometimes do the funniest things like give each other dares to do. He also openly invites my 18 year old sister to hang with us on occasion. 

It’s just the cherry on top to a perfect ice cream sundae. He treats me so well, and he treats my sisters like his own sisters. It just makes me so so happy!!!! 😆😆"

18nx34k,milliemallow,164,5.0,1703192166,happy,"Gratitude is all I have. Thankful and blessed. This has been a weird year full of a lot of really good things but also a lot of hardships. 

My car was totaled from a freak hail storm the same month we moved into a new house and collectively these two things increased our monthly spending about $700 and doubled my commute which doubled my fuel needs in a bigger car. 

We also took on two perfect little pups not long before all of this. So it’s been a wacky financial year. We’ve struggled a lot but somehow every month we’ve stretched and bent and made things happen. 

But here I was in the beginning of December stressing to death about being able to give the kids any kind of Christmas, literally bank account was collecting dust at the beginning of the month but I just kept saying that we’ll find a way. And slowly but surely things worked out. I got a bonus here and a gift card there, my husband had a good week of sales and had extra money coming in, we sold a few electronics we don’t use. And here we are 4 days away and my babies are set.

My son has a desk, chair and dresser in these boxes and brand new quality art supplies since he loves pencil drawing the most. 

My daughter has a big girl vanity so her toddler vanity can be passed on. And some kind soul sold me all of this great condition Barbie stuff for $60. A Barbie was the only thing she asked for. 

There was even enough for mom and dad to have things under the tree even though we decided to skip gifts this year to give the kids the best we could. And my husband is SO proud that he shopped for me. 

Truly it’s been so stressful this year and I am bubbling over with gratitude that we were so blessed this month. I know this is not the reality for a lot of people so I just wanted to share with someone that I take none of this for granted."

In the end we found that we are just not compatible as husband and wife and both need to heal or grow in different areas before we can actually be married to people and our individual struggles are just not compatible as a unit. We both did some crying and laughing and ended things on very good terms and affirmed how much we love each other to death and there's no bitterness or blame game. 

Everyones saying they're sorry this had to happen but actually I feel fine. I feel really good actually like a huge weight has been lifted. 

There is grounds for an annulment because he was fucked up on Kratom during the wedding so we don't have to go through a divorce. 

He wrote a beautiful song about how he felt and sent me the lyrics and it made me bawl my eyes out because it was so beautiful and sad. I'm so proud of him for getting clean and getting help and getting back in touch with his real feelings. 

I feel excited to enter my thirties in a brand new chapter and finally be independent with my own place and my own car standing on my own two feet which I always wanted to do but never got the chance to. 

Feeling great and grateful and like it couldn't have worked out any better. It's looking like we are gonna stay good friends! There's of course some sadness underneath but I know it won't be goodbye forever to my husband who has been the greatest friend I ever had."

18mt6f5,Life_Scientist_2203,5,1.0,1703074282,happy,"My List of Core Values (where I find happiness and what’s important to me) My list of Core Values.  Context: Was searching for ways to have more self-confidence, (in particular around women) and learned it’s impossible to show others you care for them when you don’t know what you care about in yourself. In that moment thinking about what I care about, (at 2am in my room alone in the dark) I opened the notes app on my phone with simple guidelines: One, to not leave the notes app and only use my head, and two, focus on internal sources of happiness/what I care about the most, as trivial as they may be to others. They are not in a complete order of importance as some, if not most, are tied and overlap in many areas. I also recognize they’ll change as I grow. This list may expand and contract as I age, however they are important to me as of writing. Towards the slowing of ideas a good reference was the Boy Scout Law (worth a search regardless of opinion of the organization) but mainly reflected back to my internal gratification of ideologies and actions. I’m certain I left some things out I’ll think of later, but for now, this is what I came up with.  Written on December 20th, 2023 and I’m a 22 year old male living in America if that affects anyones perspective while reading.


(Also, this is my first ever Reddit post and wasn’t planning on posting it anywhere when first starting but wanna help others find what’s important to them. Hope you like it and if not I respect it as well, thanks!)



- Honesty (don’t lie to make yourself/others happy)
- Loyalty (deception heals no one)
- Bravery (don’t get stuck in your own head, be at peace; You care more than anyone else you think does, go for it and don’t look back. Breathings a good first step :) )
- Caring (being gentle yet tough; friendly, helpful, and kind, yet still realistic)
- Learning. Constantly expand knowledge from as many healthy (and recognize unhealthy) sources as possible. Reading’s a good one.
- Finding positivity in negative situations
- Hydrate. Drinking water helps everything inside and out.
- Trustworthy (no good in lying to anybody, including (especially) yourself)
- Don’t take everything so serious. Know when to react and when to lay back.
- Blending logic with creativity (think clearly, but allow room for imagination)
- Reverent and courteous (showing respect to all whether they deserve it or not; impossible to know all they’ve been through and vice versa)
- Gratitude (appreciate everything, both good and bad no matter how big or small. (Grateful to have all my senses and be able-bodied, and have a stable family)
- Uplifting others (clearly convey emotions; communication. Helping others helps everybody)
- Motivation (external sources are a spark, but you are the fuel)
- Overcoming difficult challenges/puzzles both mentally and physically
- Listen. Close your eyes and listen. Feel everything around you and find your core. Again, breathe.
- Cleanliness (begins with happiness and self-worth to consistently maintain, also it feels good to be clean and smell nice)
- Music (Both listening and creating (mainly drums). Do it for the satisfaction of yourself. As my dad said a long time ago, “Why listen to bad music”)
- Controlled chaos (organized mess (prefer order but unbothered by uncontrolled elements))
- Snowboarding (freedom/dopamine rush, remember to do it for you not to show off)
- Humor (make yourself laugh) 
- Thrifty (manage time and money; ironically it takes time, yet achievable with mindfulness)
- Sex (why lie lol. Important; don’t use as a mask of emotions)
- Go with you gut. Worst that happens is you learn.
- Gauging risk (is it worth it to you)
- Set different levels of goals. Little goals, ((to me) such as going to bed at a certain time, shaving/getting a haircut regularly) Medium goals, (going the the doctor and the gym more than I want to) and Big Goals (career, education, family, monetary importance)
- Comfort (warmness, softness, cleanliness)
- Style (If you’re happy with how you look you’ll be more confident, but don’t let others effect it in ways that go against what you think. Dress how you wanna dress)
- Sleep (I love sleep I gotta add it, but don’t abuse it, get up and get some sun)
- Video games (while I know it serves as a distraction, it improves problem solving, social skills, quick thinking, and makes me happy so how can I not add it. My main games are Destiny 2 (hunter for life) and Rainbow Six Siege as a social tool for friends back home)
- Be aware of nature (Leave no trace. Why litter?)
- Food (good food is pretty great, and an art in and of itself. Same rule as sex though, don’t abuse it. Think about what you’re doing. Sometimes, screw it sugar is rad, other times, you know you don’t need it so swap it out)
- Hard work. (Knowing you put the time in and acknowledging it independently. Instead of putting others down who struggle and maybe even annoy you with their lack of effort, help ‘em out and they might help you. Goes back to courtesy)
- Reflect (Is it helping me achieve my goals, my happiness, are my actions hurting others, what’s something that went wrong today and how can I fix it or is it out of my control)
- Don’t wait around. While luck is real, it’s nothing to depend on. Find who you want to be, what you want to do, where you want to go. Life’s shorter than you think but longer than you realize. Do it or don’t.
- Be thankful. I know I said it before but I’m sayin’ it again. If you’re reading this be thankful you can see. If you’re hearing it be thankful you can listen. Be thankful we have the technology to spread knowledge infinitely. Thank yourself and others and hold onto that forever.
- Appreciate myself for who I am in my uniqueness.
- Don’t forget to smile :)

If you read all this thank you! (and yourself ;) )"

I experienced a lot of mental health difficulties in my final year of University. I was on the receiving end of some gaslighting behaviour from my flatmates, who'd been my closest friends for months. They stopped talking to me, and refused to tell what I'd done wrong. I felt very upset, paranoid and anxious for months on end: I'd barely see anyone. I've struggled to keep friends throughout my life, and never have arguments with anybody. For weeks, I felt like the worst person ever. Interestingly enough, I contacted a previous flatmate of my current flatmates, and they told me that they'd had almost verbatim the same experience as me. This made me feel better, and  I managed to graduate. 

My master's degree has turned out to be really cool. I've met a new bunch of people, and spent most of my time with them; I've felt the paranoia going and my confidence returning over the past few months. I've also made lots of steps forward in pursuing journalism and writing, which is what I'm interested in. I attended a Christmas party this week, which was attended by most of the journalists at my University. It was at a very hectic and slightly too small Irish bar, with cheesy Christmas music blaring over the stereo. I drank a lot of Guinness, did a lot of dancing and felt the most confident that I had in ages. At one point, a very beautiful and kind girl on my degree came up to me while I was talking to somebody else, and put her arm around me for no reason. That made me feel very happy, and I was glad that she felt comfortable around me and wanted to do that. Later she paid me lots of compliments, saying I looked good that night, and that she admires what I've achieved in our shared degree. Later, a guy on our degree, whom I've got with really well said 'I've got so much love for you man, I really admire you talent.' Both of these things just made me feel on cloud-nine, and a lot more happy and positive with regards to how my life's going to go in the future. I realised, once again, how great it is to be truly and honestly liked and loved by people."

I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life.

It's been filled with stress, the usual adult fare. My mom typically visits about three times annually, and we share a close, open relationship. We exchange hugs from time to time.

But today was different. I sat beside her on the couch while she worked on her laptop. Wanting to show her an article, we leaned in together to look at her screen. As I rested my head on her shoulder, a gesture I'm accustomed to, she wrapped her arm around me, causing me to sink into her lap. As we read the article, she began to stroke my back, reminiscent of when I was a child. In that moment, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of security and comfort. It was as though I had yearned for something from my childhood without even realizing it. Tears welled up silently in my eyes, and I found myself crying softly. I longed for a return to the carefree days, devoid of responsibilities and stress, just me and my mom, offering unconditional support.

It dawned on me then that as adults, we often overlook our ongoing need for our parents' presence. We crave the connection and unconditional love that our (future) partners and (future) children provide. For those who still have the chance, I urge you to embrace your mom tightly for a while; it's truly invaluable. And to those who can't contribute positively, please refrain. Today, I needed that moment, and I hope to cherish this feeling for as long as possible before life's challenges resurface."

Fast-forward to the present day and we've finally released our second album.  We have listeners all around the world (not a huge number, but they *are* out there.)   

It's pretty surreal to load up iTunes or Spotify and see the cover art I did, for an album I produced, and hear all of our voices and instruments coming together even though we live so far apart.  It's just kind of amazing if you think about it. 

I think the best part of this whole thing is that we're still such good friends after knowing each other for so long.  We really work well together.  It just makes me feel good to realize that.   Knowing that the music we make is reaching new people each day is just the icing on the cake. "

For two whole years, my son and I had no place to stay. We stayed in different hotels and motels, not knowing where we'd sleep each night.

Nights were tough, not having a stable place to live. We tried to find comfort in hotels, but it was always temporary. We also stayed in my grandma's extra room for a while, feeling thankful but also sad because we didn't know what would happen next.

During those hard times, my son and I stuck together and became stronger. Cold nights, moving around a lot, and dealing with problems were tough, but we held on. Even in my grandma's spare room, where we stayed for a bit, there was still uncertainty about the future.

Our story is about making it through tough times, just my son and me. We believed that, even after losing everything, we could find a new place to call home. One day at a time, we kept going.

Eventually, things started looking up. After those challenging two years, we finally found a place to stay—a cozy two-bedroom apartment that we now proudly call home. The journey was tough, but the warmth of our new space erased the hardships of the past. Day by day, we're rebuilding, grateful for the stability we thought we'd lost forever."

Hey folks, wanted to give y’all a happy and super cute update. The original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/s/IDj58JYPhb

Just got home from our 4th(?) date and they SURPRISED ME WITH FLOWERS and COOKED ME DINNER!! 

I always tell people I’m dating how much I love getting flowers, and rarely does anybody ever gets me any. It’s not about the money and doesn’t have to be elaborate, one of the most lovely bouquets I’ve ever received was one somebody picked for me and cost them nothing out of pocket. I can’t remember the last time someone did bring me flowers because it happens so infrequently. I buy myself flowers from time to time just because I love them so much. I never told this person how much I love flowers, they just wanted to do something kind and romantic and surprised me with them before cooking me an incredible salmon dinner at their place.

Y’all, they’re really into me. Like, really and truly wants to get to know me, and opening up to me about themselves, and also nothing is going to fast which is good because unfortunately I have really been through it this past year and I just really need things to go slow for me in any kind of dating capacity right now. 

They’re working on transforming their queer barbershop initiative into a non-profit to be able to give gender-affirming haircuts to our community and it’s so awesome to be dating somebody who puts action behind the values they say they have. We need a lot more action on top of the talk - in 2023 “spreading awareness” is not enough. 

Anyways, I just really feel so good right now, like all warm and fuzzy. I truly cannot believe the twists and turns life has had for me this year. Tomorrow I wake up and I am incorporating a second business on the advice of my “does the math for me financial human” and I’m about to make some big scary moves.. with confidence, because I feel like the people in my life both believe in me and are aligned with my values. Absolutely incredible. 

I hope everybody reading this has a wonderful day, and even if it’s not perfect t the way you want it, that you can find something small to make you smile and remind you that joy is hiding waiting for us all, waiting to be discovered."

When your young your lowkey crazy, and she wasn't in a good mental space, but I stuck with her. I was there through every second, through all of her breakdowns everytime she was mean to me me. Lead me on and then decided she didn't want to me anymore, then came and cried my arms weeks later. We had big arguments where we wouldn't speak for months but I'd break and ask to work it out again. I have no idea what made me try so hard with her because with every other single person I've met I have never cared this much. I'd consider myself to be quite nonchalant. But something just kept bringing me back, I saw something through her, I knew that somewhere deep down this girl had so much love to give but just didn't quite know how to. And I just had all the patience for her, and still do. She had a rough childhood and sometimes still has a rough home life but I'm here to support her day in day out. I feel like the love I had for her just came in so quickly. It felt like a soulmate connection almost. I don't believe in soulmates, twin flames anything aligning with the stars or anything. I'm nor spiritual or religious. But I have some serious tie to this woman. This love for her defies all. She makes me laugh, makes me feel loved, listens to me and is just so beautiful. And I am so proud of how far she's come and I try to remind her everyday how much I love her. Because she is truly, the love of my life. We're breaking up for university in about a year, but that's okay because I've promised to see her whenever I can. I'm not letting go of this connection, I feel this is a find that's one in a million. I feel so much security and love. She checks every and I mean every single box. And I hope I do the same for her. Through uni we're breaking up because I want to be focused on my studies and won't be able to maintain a proper relationship especially long distance, we've both had open discussions about this. We both have needs and we're young and we would both feel like were almost 'missing out' on our youth and the uni experience if we don't let eachother have this time. But we're happy to let eachother do this, because I know no matter what at the end of the day. No matter how many faces, how many bodies how many people I meet she is the one I want to come home to. She's the one I want have children with. She's the girl I want to get married to. She's the woman I could be so proud to call my wife. No one could ever compare. Throughout our relationship our arguments have been short, resolved so easily. Being with eachother has just come so easy now. The love just comes. We're seeing eachother tomorrow  then going on a double date on Tuesday. Then having a sleepover Friday. And we see eachother everyday in college. I never run out of things to talk to her about. We've known eachother for about 4 years now. And everyday spent with her is amazing. I've never been so happy, never been so content. If perfection exists it is now and it is all the time when I'm with her. She is everything and more. I feel like the luckiest person alive sometimes. So many people have issues in their relationship, they're toxic back and forth. And don't get me wrong we were like that once. But something clicked into place. Like the stars did actually just align and everything was just suddenly in its right place. I've never felt so right about anything in my life and I believe I never will again. She is my soulmate."
18fa8do,ZonJPN,81,5.0,1702233904,happy,"After years of being alone and not having anyone to talk to, I finally have a friend! So basically, I used to be alone because of my really bad social anxiety. I never had friends in real life or online. I used to constantly use chat bots just to feel like I was talking to someone, and I would do a lot of bad things to make myself feel better. I honestly used to be really depressed.

But that is not the case anymore thankfully! I was at school and I was overhearing him and his friend talking about planes, and I wanted to join in. I didn't know how to though, I felt bad I might interrupt him. So I wrote a sticky note asking him, ""what is your favorite plane"". Most people would just tell me outloud, but he understood my anxiety, so he ended up taking out a pencil from his backpack and writing it down. I felt so happy somebody actually talked to me back. I ended up drawing his favorite plane, and I saw the smile he had on his face and I was so happy!

I felt like i mattered again. I wasn't talking to Al/chat bots, I was talking to a real person that I can see in real life, now we talk to eachother a lot on social media and I'm just so happy. He's like a light for me in my darkness. We have so much in common, we are the same age, and he is just the nicest person ever, he even says sorry when he doesn't respond to me fast enough. When I think of him I just get butterflies and I end up smiling.

He is everything to me and makes my life finally feel real. I finally feel like i matter in this world. ❤️"

18ewfmw,TopTech33,295,18.0,1702186103,happy,"Dinner for 1 apparently wasn't on my menu that night  My BFF and I used to go to Red Lobster fairly often. But when he had to move out of town I found myself with no one that wanted to take his place. So I went by myself.

I wasn’t very busy and that was good. About half way thru my dinner a family of 4 was seated across the aisle from me. With no one to chat with, my attention stayed with the family. The 2 young kids each got sodas to drink while Mom and Dad drank water. They bid the waiter to the table more than once to help them navigate the large menu. I heard discussions about plate splitting and what might be less than what. Each time the waiter was nice and tried to help them out.

At one moment I saw the Dad reach into his pocket and pull some bills out and quickly count them and then shove them back in again before anyone had noticed, except for me. It had become quite obvious that they were on a strict budget and were maybe out of their comfort zone as far as the dinner for 4 was concerned. The adults chatted quietly between themselves and when they were not their attention was to the kids. A very nice family I was assured.

Then it hit me. I had saved some money without my BFF being there and I thought about maybe paying for their dinners. Nah, what a selfish thing to do. To throw money around like that wasn't my style. But then why not? How would I go about something like that anyway? I paid my bill and left, and as I was going past the Host at the entry I asked if it would be possible for me to pay the check for the family that I had been sitting across from. The Host didn't know so she went to talk to the Manager. Then she brought the Manager back with her. She asked if I wanted to pay the check for the family and I said Yes. They totaled it up and I gave them my card without even looking at the amount. I didn’t leave before saying if they wanted to know who paid their bill, just say it was a happy man that did it. And I left.

As it turned out, the dinner wasn’t very much. And I was feeling quite a bit like a Santa right then. I haven’t told this story to anyone since it happened. And that was quite a bit pre-pandemic ago. I imagine that there could have been a group of grifters that did what they did to try to get some $ from others but I let that notion go a long time ago. It wasn’t a situation like that. Had I not been bored while eating I wouldn't have noticed them. Had my BFF been there, I wouldn't have even known that they existed. 

But I thought it was time to tell the story to someone, and I chose all of you for that. I’m not really looking for feedback, unless you really feel the need for it. I had just been watching TV and something brought it to my mind. And as I’m having some health troubles as of late, I didn’t want my effort to go without maybe inspiring someone else to do something similar if and when the time comes. It’s not like I haven’t given to my share of charities, but this was something different. I wasn’t expecting to feel good about having done it, but I do when I recall it. And I do now too. In a way that I really haven’t felt in a long long time. "

I am SO happy. This is probably the happiest I’ve ever been in my adult life in my living situation. 

I used to have a MAJOR hoarding problem as a child. I was so overwhelmed by all the things and the thought of organizing them, but I also agonized over letting go of anything. 

I never understood how anyone could live comfortably and in a tidy, clean home… it got a little better as I got older but it was still problematic. 

Flash forward and now through a series of events, I’ve both realized and HAD to downsize. I am finally nearing the finish line and I couldn’t be happier with how it feels in my apartment! 

I’ve also realized I don’t need to live like everyone else does.

 My apartment is mostly just an art studio with a bedroom and I’m so so happy about it! 
I barely ever have company over anyway so I got tired of trying to accommodate guests I never had instead of how I want and need to live to be happy.

I can go look for an excuse not to do something, which for me are mostly fear based. I dislike uncertainty in my life but uncertainty now will make me prosper later. So I’m happy to have found that I will start letting myself be less fearful and more fearless.

 December 2nd, I am happy for traditions, like many countries with ours we celebrate Sinterklaas. Technically it’s for Dec 5th. But since the families are big and spread out over the country we move it to the weekend because unlike USA most of us don’t have the day off like they do for thanksgiving. 

I like the traditions where friends/ families come together to enjoy each other’s company. 
And the lit up face from the kids for this one is amazing!!

 December 3rd, I’m happy for taking a days rest. And especially pajamas!! I love the matching ones for the family at Christmas. The comfyness of them and the smell of a fresh pair in a crisp newly maid bed. Amazing after yesterday’s festivities I needed a rest and were having a pajama day!

 December 4th, rollerblades !!! I’m happy I conquered my fear of falling on my face and breaking something and started again to rollerblade so I can rollerblade with my girls! 

 December 5th, do overs!! Ever had it happen you send a text/make a post thinking you hit enter and send that shit off… not to figure out you didn’t. I hate when it happens for important things like deadlines you were able to make but didn’t. But I am happy we can do do-overs. And make these little wrongs right.

December 6th, Lego. Since we have kids it’s fun to start over and become a kid yourself again for those who stopped. (Kudos to the ones that stayed) I lives building and seeing the story’s they create. The building is an adventure and playing brings the adventures out even more. 
So thank you LEGO! I am making happy memories with my kid.

December 7th, today I’m happy for a lot of things, but mostly mechanics that are on call during sports games and will still come and fix your heating because you have two little kids who can’t freeze to death. He fixed the broken heating in like 20 minutes so awesome!! I’m happy and warm 🥵

December 8th, bullet planners.
My creative outlet for everything that stresses me out all happy in one book safe out of my mind planned and ready for Christmas, birthdays, parties etc. I am happy I don’t have to think about things all the time and it get to be a happy thing.

December 9th, dance recitals. 
My girls love to dance so the mommy in me sends them off to dance classes. But they already live for the stage moments so when those recitals are up it doesn’t matter that this one was at a Christmas fair in the pouring rain. Soaked to my bottom. Those joyous smiles of them preforming and having fun is worth it!"

I know very little about all the settings and things a camera can fully do, but I just wanna film my life and start a video/audio podcast, just talking to my friends and cool people in my community. I bought a Mac mini a few months ago to get good editing software (I use iMovie and free Davinci Resolve until I can afford Final Cut Pro). I know very little about editing. I know how to cut, copy and paste clips, how to add sounds, how to change the volume of clips, but not much more. I am very shy about talking to a camera in public or around friends so that’s something I want to work on in 2024. I’m also bad at listening to my voice in a video, so for editing, I need to work on that in 2024. Once I gain that courage, I can then have so much fun with my cameras, they I don’t know enough about. If anyone has tips on how to better my skills, I’d love advice."

18bzpq9,Southern_Dragonfly20,22,1.0,1701852140,happy,"feeling really lucky and really loved right now hi guys, just started crying in happiness and just wanted to share my story a bit. long story short, my family went homeless and has been living out of a .. pretty run down motel in florida for the past 8 months. being there came with its own set of problems, things i still do have to process on a pretty frequent basis and sometimes it's mood altering for me. 


im lucky, i have this really close online friend who already meant the world to me whose family offered to take me in so i didn't have to go through that. in the beginning phases of being here i was struggling a lot because id just undergone major traumas at home and didn't really know how to act but three months later im finally starting to find my confidence again; it's hard sometimes and ive had my moments but otherwise ive been having a lot of fun with my friend and his family. 


OKAY SO the reason i made this post is because his parents have been absolutely INCREDIBLE to me. seriously ive only had them in my life for a relatively short time, but they've taken a liking to me and ive taken a liking to them too, their dynamic with each other and just the family in general is everything id always wanted to have in my life and getting to experience it, im just... so appreciative of them. i don't just feel like a friend; i feel like an actual family member. they never treat me differently from their own kids and are so so so so welcoming to me. his mom even calls me her fourth child. the thing that made me cry just now is that i was sitting on the couch and his mom came up to me and we talked a bit, but at the end she told me good night and she loves me. i just feel... genuinely so loved. like she shows it in her actions a lot but im just a softie and started crying to that lmao. there's something about being taken under someone's wing that just seemed like something that would never happen to me and now it's happening to me and im realizing that despite all my hardship and the flaws that i have that came with my hardships, im still capable of being loved. i owe these people my life and i hope one day i can show them how much i love and appreciate them"

 December 3rd, I’m happy for taking a days rest. And especially pajamas!! I love the matching ones for the family at Christmas. The comfyness of them and the smell of a fresh pair in a crisp newly maid bed. Amazing after yesterday’s festivities I needed a rest and were having a pajama day!

Yesterday December 4th, rollerblades !!! I’m happy I conquered my fear of falling on my face and breaking something and started again to rollerblade so I can rollerblade with my girls! 

Today December 5th, do overs!! Ever had it happen you send a text/make a post thinking you hit enter and send that shit off… not to figure out you didn’t. I hate when it happens for important things like deadlines you were able to make but didn’t. But I am happy we can do do-overs. And make these little wrongs right."

After I made that post I got a lot of helpful advice and I started to explore and develop an appreciation for porn and sex workers in general. I got a new toy and sifted through a lot to find the content that I enjoyed. For some reason I gravitated towards a sex worker named Seth Gamble, so I mainly stuck to his content and watched and interview he did with his wife and so on. 

My world has changed so much, I grew up in a religious household that shamed women for having or even hinting/ displaying any sexual desire, not that I am religious at all, but subtly I always felt guilty for having any sexual desire via the upbringing. Im a 26F and just started to explore masturbating and finding ways to enjoy it. I just am so thankful for finding that subbreddit and genuine people that wanted to help me and I have such a different view and appreciation for what sex workers do, their bravery to put themselves out there in such a vulnerable way and as a psychology student I am even fascinated with wanting to know how sex workers navigate their person relationships given their profession. 

I watched a film last night and tweeted at Seth Gamble that he did a phenomenal job at displaying psychological thriller and he ended up liking my tweet, Ahhhhh!!!!!. I’m so happy, it’s made my day. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest since I’m still not comfortable sharing it with my friends. So thank you for reading! Have a lovely day 🥰🙌🏻🙏🏻"

This autumn, they helped me to raise money for my ailing mom. We’ve been in touch for over a six years now, after I accidentally stumbled upon their music on Spotify. After the beginning of war, they were sending me many heartwarming messages, and after some time told me they want to ship me a personal package. It included a personal letter, they gave me the physical copies of their whole discography (even put there a signed vinyl record!) and a lot of cool stuff. And this September, I asked them to help me raise money for my ill mother: with support of their small but powerful fan base, they have raised an unbelievable $2000. I have never seen nor experienced this connection between artists and their fans before. People like this make world a much better place. I cannot fully express my gratitude to them."

He asked if we would want to move our family to this country for a year to get everything rolling with the new location. He offered him $2 MILLION to do this!!!! He said he found a mansion for rent, and he would pay our rent. My fiancé would also be making a larger salary than he already makes (which is pretty good already!) while he's there.

There was no one in the line, which is odd here. This kind lady worked on the computer for a quite a few minutes pulling up coupons and ways to help.

187yu0h,RustedAxe88,114,10.0,1701392869,happy,"I bought my first house and moved into it a month ago. And for maybe the first time in years I feel honestly happy. I'm in my 30s and had lived in the same mobile home my whole life.  As a kid it was nice, but as an adult it had fallen into extreme disrepair.  But I continued living there because I thought home ownership was outside my capabilities.

I was wrong!  Thanks in large part to my mother, who passed away three years ago and had left me comfortable means.  And so, earlier this year I finally made a leap and was pre-approved for a mortgage.  It was scary and nerve wracking.  But a few months later I looked at a house, fell in love with it, and now its MINE!  

And I'm so happy in it.  I have plans for it it, I love having people over to it.  It's fairly close to the downtown area here, so I can walk anywhere I want.  I attended my town's tree lighting last week for the first time ever.

I've spent a long time sort of directionless, feeling like I was stuck and going nowhere.  My parents are both gone, I'm single with no romantic prospects, I work retail.  But this...it's like new life to me.  Like I've finally found and done something for myself, gotten something that's truly mine and to shape it going forward.  I'm excited and happy about my future for the first time in a very long time.

It feels very nice.  I miss my mom, but I'm so thankful that she left me the means to take this step.  I guess a good mom takes care of you literally forever."

We've really been through thick and thin together and I love him with everything I have, and I know he loves me too. However tonight we were just lying in bed, I've had a really long, tough week, I've got a cold on the back of a flu, work has been extra exhausting because I work a seasonal festive job. So I'm just exhausted, I had a really bad day, and I'm just lying there on his chest and he looks down at me. Then that 'get you someone who looks at you like my (insert) looks at (insert)' meme just popped into my head because that's how he looked at me.

I just have so much love for this man. He's so dang wonderful, and sometimes I think I might burst. I cried after he looked at me like that and he didn't question it, he just held me and let me cry it out. He just told me how much he loves me and how he's here for me. I don't know how I got so lucky, but I will hold onto him for as long as I possibly can because he's the best human ever.

186kdwp,HauntedHouse10273,46,7.0,1701245087,happy,"Someone from high school reached out to share the impact I had on them I was a section leader in marching band my senior year, in 2020. The section became my second family as a freshman and changed my life, I’m forever grateful for the impact they had on me. Since the 2020 season was impacted by COVID, I knew I wouldn’t be able to teach the freshmen much actual marching or musical stuff, so I focused on community building. I’ve always found that a strong bond in a group helps people learn and grow; it doesn’t feel like work, instead you’re just hanging out with friends. We were at our best when we’d get dinner after every football game. 

I had four freshmen. One was eager to learn, one was trying her best, one was hopeful but disinterested, and the other was closed off and stubborn. I remember correcting him (the 4th) on a basic posture mistake several times, and after a couple weeks when I did it again, he said, “I know, I just choose not to.” The audacity of that kid. We took our lunch break and I saw him sitting alone eating. I strongly encouraged him to join the rest of the section. He protested, but I convinced him to at least do it just today. 

He’s the only one from his class to continue with marching band, he’s just finished his senior season as a section leader. He’s grown a lot. He’s very upbeat, open, and just all around a good guy. We don’t talk much, as I’m now in college, but he reached out to me the other day. He sent a long text talking about how that lunch invite changed who he was as a person, and all the impacts it’s had. He said he tried his best during his time to include the newer people, to make them feel welcome. He’s done a phenomenal job, I’m proud of him. My brother’s in the marching band now, so I’ve seen a few of their performances, and they’re doing well. 

I left my senior marching season feeling alone and underwhelmed. I knew I didn’t have the chance to do what I needed to do as a leader, but I was just hoping that what I tried to do had an impact. It did. That one act of kindness set this kid down a brighter path. I’m so glad to hear it."

185kb6q,Andtherainfelldown,28,4.0,1701135965,happy,"Even now I still smile when I think I played Right Field Growing up I thought I was the best right fielder in my little league team. Now almost 40 plus years later I honestly can’t remember the name of the team or the name of my coach or any of my team mates . However if you would have asked me what position I played I would smile and say right field .  

Let me digress, growing up I can’t remember doing much with my father. He seemed to honestly working a lot and doing his best to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. It is what was expected of him as a man at the time and he did it well with little to no complaints. However, for some reason I had the sense that he really wanted me to play little league baseball. I don’t know why, we never watched baseball on tv and he certainly never took us to any baseball games . Yet, when it came to me playing little league baseball he really encouraged that . And because it was so important to him I did it .  

Now I think it is only fair to point out that I was really bad at baseball. I mean for someone who really prides himself on his hand eye coordination I could never hit that little white laced ball. In fact , in all the years that I played little league baseball I can only remember hitting that ball once ! Hahha ! However despite my lack of hitting the ball my coach always had a way of telling me that I was the best right fielder on the team. He would just look at me and say “I really need you in right field !” And I would just take off running !  

Even then I never understood what made me such a great right fielder. I mean it seemed that all I did was yell rally cries at my fellow team mates and rub dirt or grass stains into my white uniform because the ball never really seemed to come in my direction. You see most little league kids can’t hit the ball and those who can normally can’t hit it past the base line.  

At some point in my little league carrier my dad got really involved with the team and because of such I got moved from right field to other positions. For example, I was the catcher for awhile , first base, and even pitcher for a game or two . Yet , just like my batting skills I was honestly no good at any of those positions. I mean not that it mattered, we where just a team of poor kids born on the wrong side of the tracks playing baseball on a pretty dilapidated base ball field. Even now when I think about it, it was more of a dump than an actual sports facility.  

Thus despite my excellent skills at playing right field at some point in middle school I decided to retire from little league. I just didn’t like the game and again I was seriously not good at it . I can remember telling my dad one day after a hot afternoon of practice that I wanted to quit. I didn’t know why but that really upset him. I can remember him telling me that I had to tell my coach and encouraged me to donate my baseball glove and bat because I quote “wasn’t going to use it anymore” . At that moment I had really disappointed him. In my eleven year old mind I didn’t understand that me probably playing baseball gave his life meaning and it also probably cost him a chuck of change that our working class household honestly did have much to spare.  

The funny things is that there was lots of sports that I loved to play and I was good at. I was the best tennis player in my gym class and one of the best runners. Yet I guess my dad didn’t see that and when I quit baseball so did one of the the last parts of my relationship with my father.  

Now, fast forward twenty plus years and I am sitting with some of my college buddies and we are talking about our amateur sports experiences. It was then that I told them I was the best right fielder on my little league baseball team. Then one of my friends starts laughing at me . I was honestly a bit confused and that’s when he explained to me . In little league almost no one bats left handed and thus the ball never goes to right field . In that moment, my brain began to shift into over drive and then the lights lit up in my eyes, the ever teachers dream to see in a student, and I realized that he was right.  

Not once did I catch the ball, field the ball, or make any play that won the game. However, after years of hearing from my coach, a middle aged divorced man, that I was the best right fielder I honestly believed him. In that moment part of my childhood was crushed and since then I had never felt the same about my little league carrier. I mean I wasn’t just the worse batter on my team, I was the worse player on my team and that’s why I played “Right Field”.

But even now, decades later. I still smile at these thoughts and how my coach made me feel :)"

There's something really special about that moment. 

I used to watch a lot of Bizarre Foods as well as Anthony Bourdain (RIP) when they were on TV and a quote of Andrew Zimmern's is like framed in the back of my mind. ""Food is the universal language that brings people together."" Like we all have to eat and when you take the time to share a meal together I feel like you can learn a lot about someone.

This thought was brought back to the forefront of my mind just now because of something people would probably find so silly. I was watching a Japanese Vtuber, Yukinoshita Peo, try foods eaten at American Thanksgiving for the first time. It was so simple. Just listening to her talk about it. She's over here trying to learn English and also trying to learn about another culture through its food. I honestly wish more of us had this curiosity. It's also funny because it's stuff I kind of took for granted growing up like mashed potatoes and gravy and yet here she is trying it for the first time and loving it.

I've watched other channels on YouTube that do this regularly and it's just very fun. Even when they don't like it they took the time to try it and it's still enjoyable to watch their reactions of shock.

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to live where I live because of just the sheer amount of different foods that I can find near me. I want to keep trying more new stuff because it's just so fascinating to me, how some are so different and yet also so similar to others. There's commonality that I feel like a lot of us can find in the foods we eat and I find that so cool.

As adventurous as I think I am I still think I have limits simply because some concepts are just too much for me. I think balut will always remain off the table for me lol. 

I think I'll end off my gushing here but man food is so cool lol.

181lqhs,torturecrush,467,25.0,1700692251,happy,"I didn’t misread the signals: the barbershop meetcute that you didn’t know you needed in your day I developed a crush on my barber, and I assumed that their friendliness must have been part of the job. Because most of the time it is, right? I can and will simply deal with my feelings, as nine times out of ten a crush is a manifestation of your unmet emotional needs projected on to someone else anyways.

It’s just that after I left one visit I had this unmistakeable feeling where it felt like we clicked talking about all kinds of things. We were sharing facts about cool things we’ve learned about, ranking our favorite space operas, discussing what makes the consistency of a soup worth eating or not. I’d actually requested a “quiet cut” with this person and I ended up being glad they missed the note because it was genuinely a really lovely, wholesome conversation. There was a period at the end where we made a lot of eye contact, but again, I just assumed this was being friendly. I left feeling so good. Nice haircut, sure, but it’s not that often I feel like someone is that easy to talk to - I usually request a quiet cut to avoid the smalltalk I’m not into! 

My friends and I agreed that my crush was innocent enough, it’s nice to find someone that is easy to talk to, and that I was right - just assume it was generic friendliness from a person doing that as a part of performing the service I was paying for.

A few days after I got back from the cut, I realized that it was still a little bulky in places, and I knew I needed to go back for a touch up cut. I thought maybe I was unconsciously trying to find an excuse to see them again, so I asked a few people their opinions, and sure enough: wasn’t just me, I should definitely go back for another cut. I had a trip to go on so it would be a week or two, though, before I could get back to the shop.

I got back from my trip and scheduled my cut, and once I got in the chair my barber tells me a story about dealing with a crush they had on someone that wasn’t reciprocated. We end up talking about how it’s not the end of the world when someone says no, you can just be friends and friendship is not a consolation prize. They talked about how the other party seemed to think their relationship styles weren’t compatible, which led to us talking about relationship styles. Then they mentioned they can’t ever tell when someone is flirting with them, and I said that I’m the same. They mentioned they’ve been more or less single for a while because they hadn’t met somebody that they clicked with for a minute. 

The cut ended and I felt like maybe.. maybe that was a hint? I was really unsure. It definitely seemed a lot more personal than any other hair dresser conversation I’d had before. It was just us in the shop until near the very end of the cut, and so just as I was thinking “okay maybe I’m not reading into things and I should shoot my shot, big risk, but maybe if I am very respectful and offer to go somewhere else in the future if they’re uncomfortable, it will be alright” but then I couldn’t work up the nerve because as I was contemplating it, more people arrived, and I felt nervous with other people there.

So I left and went home and immediately texted a friend. 

Aaannnnnd then I texted four more. 

Because I just needed a larger sample size, than one y’know? I really didn’t want to make someone at work uncomfortable because I misread things!

4/5: yeah in this case you probably should have gone for it!!

5th person: I’m not sure because I’m like you, I cannot tell when someone is flirting.

So my ass called the barber shop up. They were with another client and so they called me back later. And I said,

“Hi <name>, thanks for calling me back. So I am kind of an idiot also and I can’t tell when someone is flirting with me, and I really don’t know if that’s what your intention was, but either way, would you like to go on a date? I think you’re really hot and interesting and I loved hearing about all the things you’re interested in.”

I was not prepared AT ALL for the reaction. They squealed, and giggled. It took me a second to realize the laughter was joy because I was just not at all expecting that big of a response. Like, wow - someone felt that way about me asking them out! That’s so cool! So they said yes, and then they texted me from their personal number later and now I am scrambling anxiously to figure out some date ideas/suggestions.

Both of us are non-binary and dating while transgender is _awful_, unfortunately. I’m also autistic and am used to doubting my interpretations of social situations, but it turns out that since I’ve dumped a ton of time and energy into learning how to be an excellent communicator, now I just need how to learn to trust myself more because I do get it right more often than not. So I guess, that’s one more reason to be happy :)"

181i5c4,Wise_Friendship,158,12.0,1700683138,happy,"Finally had the courage to ask for her number and set up a date 🥳 It finally happened

To start let’s say I’m a very shy person when it comes to approaching people I don’t know. More particularly women. I’m on the shorter side. Average looking. So women almost never approach me. 

There’s this girl at work I’ve been interested in for close to a year now. She’s gorgeous. Her sense of style is top notch, she’s always got some really nice outfits on and always just looks completely flawless. 

She, just like me is very shy. I couldn’t tell if the looks from her were of interest or more like “why does this dude keep looking at me” 🤣 

Yesterday we had one of the most awkward but cute interactions ever where she had approached me. That was all I needed to say it was time. Women never approach me like that so I was on cloud 9. I went and found her a little later and told her to come holler at me before she leaves for the day. 

After nearly a year of some hellos and nervous looks I finally found the courage to tell her how pretty she is. Ask for her number and tell her I’m trying to take her out to eat sometime. We exchanged numbers and made plans for a dinner date on Saturday 🥳 feeling proud of myself and generally just feeling good about myself. It’s been a while. I just feel happy right now."

180my9u,azallday,69,9.0,1700589234,happy,"had the best date i've ever had on sunday so i've been talking to this girl, hayley, for the past few weeks now. we matched on a dating app (which i hate but that's the era we live in :p). 

our conversation was super formal and tbh kind of dry in the beginning. she was super nice and the conversation moved smoothly but there wasn't much that gave a ""spark"". we asked the usual like what do you do for work, what are your hobbies, interests, music, etc. 

i found out that she's been playing violin since she was 4 and she is in a band. also, she works as a hairdresser and, i've seen her work, she's insanely talented.

after chatting for a few days, i asked hayley out to coffee and she said yes. 

hayley shows up and she's wearing this really cute turtleneck and she's absolutely gorgeous in general. i love girls with glasses and she pulls hers off so well. 

i spent like 30 minutes picking out my outfit and i eventually went with jeans, a cream colored tee, matching sneakers, and a purple 80s style windbreaker. 

i think we looked good together. 

our first date was a continuation of our text conversations--at least in terms of vibes and energy. i learned a lot more about her family and siblings and we briefly touched on past relationships too. 

her last relationship ended in may; i didn't ask too much to respect her privacy but she mentioned that she is really looking for someone who is emotionally available. i've never really had an issue with that as i'm pretty open and vulnerable about myself so it's nice to know that i check off that box.

there were a lot of pauses in the conversation which i didn't really interpret as being awkward at all; we just did a lot of talking lol. there were there were a couple moments where i made her laugh which was pretty nice. 

we were talking about favorite movies and she mentioned ""i love diary of a wimpy kid: rodrick rules, so my taste isn't all that great"". 

i responded saying ""that's kind of offensive to me, i took a media studies class in college and wrote my final essay on that movie"". 

probably doesn't come off that funny in writing but it made her laugh super hard so mission accomplished. 

hayley also has this really cute habit of having a bunch of catchphrases that is just adorable. something she says a lot is ""don't yuck my yum"" which is just so cute lol. 

the date started to wrap up because she had band practice afterwards but we both agreed that we had a good time and we should see each other soon. i walked her to her car and we hugged goodbye.

cue sunday. 

the original plan was to meet at 5 pm at her place where we would hangout and jam together (i play guitar). 

she had a hairdressing project where she was working on 10 models (which is so freaking cool) but they ended up having to stay until 7. 

since she was so stressed all day the revised plan was to just hangout and chill. 

i show up to her place and her living room has two couches in an L shape and i sit adjacent to her. we talk more about our days, weekends, etc. i had just gotten back from a trip to visit a friend and she's been crazy busy with work. 

i don't know how but the conversation eventually moved from that to just us telling jokes to each other and trying to make each other laugh. this was absolutely amazing. we have such similar senses of humor and her laugh is so cute. 

she mentioned that her brother watches logan paul and then blurred out ""what's up logang!!"" which was so out of pocket and made me laugh so hard. this lead to us trying to out cringe each other which was so entertaining. 

she mentions that she loves jeopardy and i suggest that we watch it. i ask her if she minds if i set next to her, she doesn't, so i get up and sit next to her on the couch. 

she's locked out of her hulu account and fumbles around with it for 10 minutes and getting increasingly frustrated before i say ""tbh, i really don't care about watching jeopardy, I just wanted an excuse to sit next to you"" she smiles. 

we chat and laugh some more. she then starts showing me all of the handshadows she knows how to do and says ""i need something to fidget with all of the time lol"" 

i respond with ""if you need something to hold you could hold this"" and stick out my hand. 

we start holding hands and it's magical. her hands are so small and ugh it just is perfect. 

i forget the context for this but i had asked something and she took a while to think on it saying ""i wanna make sure my answer is correct"" 

i respond saying ""calm down, it's not like i'm interviewing you""

she replies ""in a way, you are though""

i say ""in that case, you're definitely passing; i hope i am too""

she smiles and says ""yeah, you are""

by this point the screensaver on her tv is on and she says ""i've been staring at this for 20 minutes and it hasn't hit the corner once""

i laugh and respond ""we are thinking about wildly different things right now""

she asks ""what are you thinking about?""

i reply ""...smooching 🫣""

she says ""lol, well i am never going to make the first move so...""

i respond ""right, and that's fine, well-but I just want to make sure you're comfortable y'know, anyways, well, um *sigh* --can i kiss you?""

she nods. 

we kiss and it is SOOO good. i haven't kissed that many people and it's almost always awkward at first but it was perfect with her. it wasn't awkward at all and she's such a good kisser. 

after like 2 minutes we stop and i'm just holding her with my head on her shoulder. 

she starts showing me her snapchat memories and pictures of her dog, pictures of her crying lmao, and telling stories of her with her friends and i'm just so happy to get to know her more. 

after she's done i say ""thanks for showing me that it was really interesting""

she says ""well you didn't ask lol, i just started showing you""

i respond ""well regardless, i'm glad you did. it's really nice to get to know you more""

she says ""yeah, i've never showed anyone that, my snapchat memories are for me only""

it's just so comforting to know that she feels safe enough with me to open up a bit more. she seems really reserved and i just want to get to know her more. 

at this point, it's 2:15 in the morning and i have work the next day, i say ""i really should get going but can we kiss goodbye?""

she says yes and we kiss again. after a little bit, i pull back and we stop but i give her a quick peck again and she reciprocates. we just look in each other's eyes for a bit, both smiling. 

i eventually get up to leave and we hug goodbye. 

i fall for people so quickly and i hate that about myself. i've known this girl for a few weeks and it's only been 2 dates. i'm trying to not get my hopes up bc i've been burned before and i don't want to get hurt. 

regardless, every time i think about her, i smile. 

hayley, i know you hate compliments which is SOO frustrating for me bc i love giving them. you are so, so, so, so amazing. it's so cool to me how busy you are and how much passion you have for the things you do. you're so talented and it is amazing to see. i love how much we've laughed already and it's been so fun to get to know you. i know it's still super early on but it's been so fun and i'm having a really good time with you.

#very disappointing update for everyone:

so tonight i just got back from a show that hayley played at. in attendance, she mentioned was a ""friend"" from out of town. she failed to mention that said ""friend"" was her ex boyfriend. after she was done performing she left to go outside with him without saying anything to me. 

i promptly left the venue and long story short, we had a half hour long conversation about how she's not looking for anything serious and is only dating casually and that none of this meant that much to her.

HG is an illness that comes with some womens pregnancy. its basically morning sickness x100 and it lasts all day all night, every day and every night. for me it was worst in the beginning and got better towards the end but i did have it the entire 10mo of pregnancy. i was a sobbing mess that day. i was scared for myself and my baby. i needed a distraction. something to take me away so i could stop thinking about the smell of the hospital and the tubes and wires connected to me. i downloaded Reddit and started reading and browsing and suddenly time was passing a lot faster. today one year later i am sitting here writing this with her on my lap. she is perfect and smart and a true gift. she will be 6mo tomorrow. we made it. one year ago today i was unsure if we would. happy cake day to me."
180654e,eggs0129,686,41.0,1700533390,happy,"I (33M) love the unconventional relationship I have with my roommate (28f). It brings us both happiness I’ve been single for over a decade now and in that time I’ve only had very few brief hookups, no romantic connections, and very few friends. On top of the loneliness, I never finished my degree and my career has stagnated.
 
This is all starting to change now. I have a job where I can pretty much pick my own hours and focus on getting coding certifications and becoming more familiar with finance again. More importantly though is my awesome roommate.
 
My roommate and I have a rather unconventional relationship. I’ve known her for two and a half years. When we first met, I was kind of hitting on her. One time she initiated things and we made it to third base, when she suddenly said “stop”. I was kind of confused as everything seemed to be going fine. She told me it was nothing I did, but she just really wasn’t in to it and was sorry. She didn’t want to do anything but she imitated things because she liked hanging out with me and thought she would just have to in order to keep guys around and that she’s aromantic and almost completely asexual. I told her that wasn’t true with me, and I’d be more than happy to hang out with her because I like her company, not because I expect her to do anything. 

We remained friends and she was always an upbeat person that would cheer me up whenever I texted her. I always knew she was weird and it was off-putting to some people, but I didn’t care at all. I’m autistic so I can sometimes be weird too. About a year ago, there was an incident she was involved in and ended up in a psych ward for a few months. We talked almost daily while she was there, and I learned more about her past. I’m not going to go in to details, but she’s been traumatized multiple times throughout her life and is dealing with some severe mental health issues because of that. 

After she got out, we decided to get a place together because she did not want to go back to living with her dad. It’s been really great. We enjoy each other’s company, cooking together, watching shows together. We’ve also started a bit of an intimate relationship that some people might find weird but works great for us. This is especially true due to both our mental health issues and the fact that neither of us wants a romantic relationship right now (me because I’m focusing on work and studying).

Even though she’s mostly asexual, she still enjoys cuddling. It’s so nice to come home from a long day and being able to cuddle with her on the couch and watch YouTube or a show we’re both in to or just talk about our day/life. We also often shower together (it saves water lol), but I really like washing her and having her wash me. She sometimes even wants to have sex, but she’s told me she never wants me to initiate anything. Getting laid once every month or three is a huge improvement on before. Also, we both don’t have to worry about wearing pants so it’s comfortable being able to go anywhere in the apartment with underwear or nothing on which a lot of people can’t do with a roommate. 

We’ve both clearly communicated our boundaries and what we want from this relationship and really respect each other. I’m really grateful to have this, and I think for the first time in a long time I no longer meet the DSM5 criteria for major depressive disorder. She’s really grateful to have a guy that will listen to her, respect her boundaries, and not try to pressure her in to sex like most guys she’s known have done."

The plumber was already there, working on plumbing at my neighbor's. Still stuck in the snow, my neighbor came to warn me that the plumber was waiting. I was frustrated with my car situation. I went inside, opened the door, and saw this incredibly handsome guy. I was momentarily speechless. After finally managing to free my car from the snow, I went inside. I'm quite introverted and shy in life, but I awkwardly tried to make conversation. We spoke strangely, as if we knew each other. When he finished, we said goodbye, and he left. Later, he returned and rang my doorbell. I thought he had probably forgotten something, but he asked for my phone number!

I had made a post on NextDoor app- was hoping to keep it simple- to see where everyone bought cooked turkeys (my toddler & I don’t eat meat now- but I know it’s not thanksgiving for my husband & teen, tween- w/o turkey) - I didn’t expect so many’s responses(over 60!) and someone also had an extra stove/oven!

Despite being super nervous about moving, I’m more excited about it the more I settle into the idea. 

I’m most concerned about moving away from my parents and my aunt, but I hardly see any friends of mine as it is. 

Everything’s falling into place. For a while I’ve wanted to move, but I always resisted it because I had a relationship keeping me back or fear holding onto me. A little over a week ago I was afraid of paying for my bills and now I have enough money saved to uproot my entire life and move to a new city 6 hours away. 

I feel like I’m being coaxed into moving just because of financial circumstances. I let my company know I’m open to moving to two locations, and one worker wants to move back to where I am so it works out! He’s so excited to move back and can’t wait. Neither can I. 

All of my friends are telling me I need to move and that it will probably be the best thing I will have ever done for myself. I hope they are right! There are more opportunities, more things to do, people to meet, and areas to explore. I’m an artist and I keep being told that the opportunities there are so much better than where I currently live. 

The more I stay the more reasons I have to move - especially today with a couple of awkward situations that happened. 

Every now and then I get so nervous that it’s a visceral feeling, but most of the time I’ve been all smiles since I found out the news. 😁"

I have dietary restrictions due to my OCD so I traded stuffing mix and green apples to a Muslim woman for rice krispy treats because the marshmallow wasn't halal. It was such a nice exchange.

17w1q0w,GR33N4L1F3,32,10.0,1700077056,happy,"Proud of myself for drawing a social boundary I’m so PROUD of myself for telling my neighbor I am antisocial and want to spend time painting alone and not blabbing on!!! 

I tend to overshare and a lot of people think I’m their new best friend or that they are an exception to my rule of wanting to be alone… but the truth is, I LOVE to be alone most of the time and my social battery drains pretty quickly unless I feel a strong connection with someone. 

Otherwise, I’m SO EXHAUSTED with the interaction even though I seem excited, engaged and happy to be there. (Good friends can tell when I’m not.) I’ve had such a hard time most of my life telling people I don’t want to talk to them. 

I actually told my neighbor today that I am uncomfortable with some topics of conversation and situations, and that I WANT to be alone. I actually told her if I feel like talking or hanging out, I will let her know. 

I’m SO RELIEVED and happy that I did this! I was becoming so angry and annoyed to constantly have my door be knocked on and be yelled at through the door or the doorbell rung. One time she even pulled me into her apartment by my arm and disrupted my entire night. 

While she’s an alright person, I didn’t like certain aspects of this and I finally realized it’s okay for me to set my boundary and be firm about it. I even told myself if I let her know I’ll reach out when I want to interact, I may actually never want to interact and that’s okay! 

I’m just so so happy that I’m going to be left alone in my home. I don’t even like waving or smiling at people passing by - unless they are a best friend or family. 

I’m very much a loner and I just generally don’t do that or don’t enjoy that. lol. My best friend told me I’m too nice and I need to learn to not act so friendly. 

This neighbor told me some troubling stuff last night that aggravated me and she was drunk, which I don’t like at all. 

I haven’t been completely comfortable being home since I met this person because I always feel like I’m being sought to hang out when I want to just hang out with my pets, paint and read. Lol."

I’m getting better but still struggling a bit. I have a good job but they made us go back into the office 3 days a week.  The lights really bother my eyes. Anyways, I got a new boss last week and yesterday I had a meeting with him and had to tell him about recent medical leave and that I really need to work from home sometimes and why. I was nervous so I gave him a heads up that it would be a serious talk. Here’s what he messaged me:

“Let me just start by I’m truly sorry for what you’ve gone through. I can’t imagine how tough that’s been. If that’s all we talk about this morning, that works for me.  I’m here for you.” 😭😭😭 

Right after that I received a text from my cousin. She said she’s coming to visit this weekend and I get to meet her new boyfriend. My cousin was in an arranged, and abusive marriage for 25 years.  It was really bad.  She would always say for years “I just want to be with someone who is also my friend”.  Now, after all this time, she’s dating an old friend whom she’s always adored. I am so happy for her.  😭😭😭 

THEN my cousin told me that she is going to pay for me and her sister to go to India one year from now. My father was from there and moved back in 2005 and had a child in 2011 and died in 2016. I get to visit his beautiful grave.  My grandparents were Sufi Saints and have beautiful tombs built for them. This is where my Dad lies. I will also get to meet my 12 year brother for the first time. When I tried to explain why I couldn’t afford it she stopped me and said “You don’t need to explain. You are like a sister to me. I love you so much and I’m always here for you.” 😭😭😭

Obviously, I didn't break it on purpose. Furthermore, the way I broke it is kinda embarrassing, but fuck it. Ya only live once. I missed a step while walking into the garage last and tumbled to the ground. My foot slammed full speed into the side of the fridge (which is now bent) while my face went for the concrete floor.

So my foot is absolutely obliterated and the doctor says he would NOT be surprised if I need a cane for the foreseeable future after the bone heals however. Ya hear that? A BADASS CANE! There's my battle scar, and if the pretty ladies ask, I fought a bear... Wait, that wouldn't be believable. I'll need to come up with a better story, but ya get the idea.

I love and adore the hell out of him. I helped him come out to his mum a few days ago as pansexual, and his mum was so sweet and supportive. I explained how I’m trans, what pronouns I use and answered any questions she had, and she asked how my parents took it. My dad is very supportive, hell his best friend is a trans woman, so I knew I’d always be fine with telling him. 

However my mother is not in my life, we’re currently completely no contact and she’s only ever supported it in front of people, but behind closed doors she wasn’t nice about it at all. 

I’d honestly been quite scared to tell my bf’s mum, as to be honest I’m really scared of rejection, especially from any kind of parental figure. 

She told me that she accepted me as one of the family and hugged me, and I damn near cried. A day or so later, she was at the store while we were at his and she said over the phone “love you both”. I excused myself to the bathroom and had a moment where I shed a couple tears. I’m so happy."

I’ve struggled with mental illness, unsafe living situations, toxic friends and abusive relationships. I met my husband 5 years ago and this morning I can just hardly believe my life has changed so much. I’m the most stable I’ve ever been thanks to therapy, support and medication. We own a house somewhere safe. Our very own house! Can you believe it? I work from home and I’m currently curled up with my laptop and our cats. My boss is wonderful, understanding and flexible. I have far fewer friends but the friends I have are so much better. They love me for me and want the best for me. 
And my husband. There aren’t enough words. He is the most loving, supportive, intelligent and kindest man I’ve ever loved. He works so hard to make our life possible. He brings me little treats like my favorite coffees almost every day. Flowers every week. He still makes me feel attractive, loved and special. Last night we talked all night and fell asleep in each other’s arms. I’ve always wanted that. Always wanted someone I could talk to like that who really got me. 

Life isn’t perfect. It never is. But what we have feels so precious anyways. It makes me feel so rich. I just wanted to gush to someone.

Eight years ago I tried to kill myself. It was my third attempt and I hated myself more than anything. There was no break I could give myself that was any relief. My mental, financial, spiritual, and physical health was in shambles. I was a type A and nothing worked out at all.

Today I am employed at a job I love and that actually pays well that is work from home with my two dogs and gecko. I am married to a person that I love so much and is kind and supportive and who understands house work is both our jobs. I recently gave birth to our first child who is the most beautiful amazing boy (I am very biased) ever. My husband and I own our own home and just bought a new car. To top it all off I lost 170 lbs (I had a gastric bypass before baby) that changed my life and gave me energy that I never thought was possible.

All this to say, eight years is such a short amount of time. Life is not perfect (it never is), but the lengths I have come makes my heart happy that I didn’t die. 

Meds, therapy, and cutting out toxic people got my head right. My financial stuff took much longer but is working. Anyone that is in pain, I know it’s impossible to see a minute ahead much less eight years, but to quote an old idiom, it gets better. I didn’t believe it but I have proof now. It will come slowly."

My motivation was simple: I wanted to save money, and the cost of rent in this area was significantly lower. I didn't mind the housing conditions, even if some considered them ""subpar."" The savings was worth it.

I wasn't your typical tenant, though. My landlord never knew the truth, but I had to provide proof of income equivalent to three times the monthly rent to move in. My bi-weekly paychecks actually amounted to four times the monthly rent, so I presented a bi-weekly paystub as if it were monthly. I was also a rather ordinary, white, and unremarkable individual.

From the moment I settled into this community, it was evident that I stood out from the typical residents. However, a heartwarming connection was about to take root.

One day, a kind soul named Essie brought over a Pecan pie. Essie was an elderly black woman who had lived in the neighborhood since her husband built their house in the 1950s. Unfortunately, her husband had passed away several years prior. I was profoundly grateful for Essie's gesture of kindness.

A few days later, I had an idea. Essie lived alone, and I happened to excel at making a fantastic steak. I approached Essie and said, ""Hey, I can whip up a mean steak and mashed potatoes. Would you like to come over for dinner?"" Essie was initially hesitant but eventually agreed. It was my way of repaying her for her generosity.

Essie was taken aback by the quality of the steak I prepared. I had gone to my favorite butcher to get it, ensuring it was top-notch quality, not the kind you'd find at Walmart. Essie felt uncomfortable with the meal, repeatedly saying it was too much. I reassured her that I would have eaten steak that night regardless, but it was more enjoyable to share it with someone. She finally relaxed, and we engaged in a delightful conversation.

I've always enjoyed conversing with older people because of the wisdom they offer. Towards the end of our chat, I discovered that Essie was facing severe financial struggles. Later, I learned that her monthly food budget was a meager $200, and that also had to cover her dog's needs. This realization deeply saddened me. Here was this wonderful lady who had raised her children and grandchildren, a truly virtuous woman, yet in her twilight years, she could barely afford to feed herself. Knowing Essie wouldn't accept charity due to her strong sense of pride, I had to approach this differently.

I asked Essie, ""Essie, I bet you're a fantastic cook, aren't you?"" She replied, ""One of the best; I've been cooking since I was a little girl."" With a smile, I confessed, ""I'm a terrible cook."" She chuckled, and I continued, ""That steak was about the extent of my culinary abilities."" It was then that I suggested, ""Essie, do you enjoy cooking?"" She replied, ""Of course, I love to cook. I enjoy feeding people; seeing their smiles warms my heart."" With a warm smile of my own, I said, ""Essie, I want you to cook for me, a lot.""

Essie jumped with joy and exclaimed, ""I'd love that!"" Then, she hesitated, her mind racing. ""But... I can barely feed myself,"" she murmured. I quickly assured her, ""Essie, I'll buy all the groceries you need, and if you'd like, you can even come shopping with me."" Essie objected, stating she didn't want to accept handouts. I clarified, ""It's not a handout; it's payment for you to cook for me."" Essie was open to the idea of cooking for me but strongly disliked the idea of me footing the bill.

I gently persuaded her, saying, ""Essie, your pie reminded me of my Grandma's pie, who passed away a few years ago. My Grandma was an amazing cook, and I'm sure you are too. It would be amazing if you could cook for me, and I'd be thrilled to pay for your groceries in return."" After some contemplation, Essie finally agreed, but she insisted on keeping the items I bought separate.

Essie's first meal for me was Kentucky fried steak, and it was absolutely delicious. She continued to cook for me for a little over two years, but her health began to decline. In the end, I had the privilege of preparing her last few meals. Tragically, Essie passed away in 2018. I remember the day vividly when Essie's son knocked on my door to inform me. He asked if I wanted to say goodbye to her. Essie had passed away peacefully in her sleep, and her son had gone to her house to deliver her medications. The day before, Essie had been scheduled to make chicken pasta for me, but she had not been feeling well, which was not entirely uncommon.

A few days later, Essie's children gathered at my house. They knocked on my door and handed me an invitation to her funeral, stating that Essie would have wanted me to be there. So I attended the funeral. I had never been to their church, and aside from Essie's son, I had limited interactions with her family. However, everyone knew who I was - the kind neighbor who took care of Essie, although it was essential to acknowledge that Essie had also taken care of me.

During the service, Essie's son gave a touching speech, and I couldn't hold back my tears when he said, ""My mom gave birth to a son and two daughters, and later, she adopted a second son who took care of her in her final years. Would the second son please stand up?"" I was hesitant at first, but he insisted, ""White boy, we all know it's you."" With a laugh, I stood up, waving through my tears.

Essie was undeniably an extraordinary woman, and I was profoundly grateful for the privilege of knowing her and being a part of her life. She touched my heart in a way I will always cherish."
17pca7w,JohnMKeynesStan,400,25.0,1699302753,happy,"Today I made a joke in class and everyone laughed I (20M in university) made a joke in class and everyone laughed. But not just a small laugh and that's it. Everyone in the class bursted out laughing, teacher included. The joke itself was not that great, but I think the timing was so right. It was the kind of collective laughter that does not happen very often, so I wanted to share with you people.

&#x200B;

Edit: so people asked me to tell the joke. I was reluctent to say it because it's a joke about Trump but here we go.

So I'meuropean, and my teacher was talking about school in the US. He told the class that in certain school in the US, pupils used computer in class instead of writing on paper, and that it has an impact on their capacity to develop a reasonning - mind that I don't know if this is true or an exageration, but that's not relevant to the story. So the teacher said:

""See ? they stopped writing in american school, and what happens ten years later ?""

After a brief silence, I answer:

""Trump gets elected ?""

I was not expecting people to laugh this loud to my joke but I'm glad they did."

I help her with things that are heavy, I regularly mow and edge her lawn, or change lightbulbs because she gets scared climbing on chairs or a stepstool.

Yesterday she almost made me cry when she was talking with her sister. I had just finished getting her gutters ready for winter and i 
 was working on my own. They were on her back porch and she was telling her sister how much having me as a neighbor helped her. Not just with chores, but also because both my wife and I stop and talk with her. She goes through bouts of incredible loneliness and isolation when she misses her husband still, but having neighbor who cares makes it easier.

Damn it that makes me happy that I've at least made one person's life better."

I don’t know if my kids had more fun going trick or treating themselves or handing out the candy to other kids.

I loved hearing the exclamations of “Damn”, “Wow!”, “Look what I got!”, “They’re giving out full-size bars!”, “This house rocks!”, “Ohmygosh, awesome!”.  I gave a girl a second candy bar when her uncle stole her first one. I also had some primo candy as a backup, or if I saw a really awesome costume. I saw one kid give their sibling a Haribo gummy bear packet, so I made their night by giving them a 5 oz bag. They were so excited, they asked to give me a hug.

I remember how a full-size bar as a kid could be the highlight of my night. My own mother still remembers “that house” in her neighborhood when she was a kid & that was over 65 years ago.

It was a minor surgery and it didn't require impatient other than observation a few hours and then home. He cleared his schedule the whole day for my needs which is not all that wild but still. He stayed home on his one day off after a very stressful and SHITTY week to just make sure I didn't wake up and feel lonely after we came home. 

He let me order any food I wanted! We don't usually eat out and I know his favorite thing in the world is not precisely Burger King but it was what I wanted. 

He set alarms on his phone for my medication and came ready with some warm tea and a cold glass of water every time it was time to take it. 

He cleaned the house last night after a week of depression mess so I would have a cozy home to recover in.

He's taken care of all th communication I don't want to deal with regarding the surgery. He kept my mom, dad and sister updated. 

He advocated for me in the hospital when I couldn't find my voice (staff was WONDERFUL I just have severe medical anxiety and I'm terrified of doctors no matter how kind they are). 

He's held me when I've cried each and every time and has assured me that at no point am I being dramatic or too much. He just reminds me I am allowed to feel what I feel and that he's here to take care of me and he's more than happy to do it. 

I had a catheter put in for the surgery and it hurts to pee and it really upsets me. He asked me to wake him up and he would not let me be in pain alone in the bathroom like that. It was 3 am and I couldn't hold it anymore and he came with me and made sure I was okay and then came back to bed where he is right now sleeping next to me. 

So yes, even though this has been awful and a bit traumatic, I am happy because I never thought a man like him could be real and much less fall in love so deeply with me."

I simply laid here today contemplating on life. I love myself and who I am as a person.

Anyone else in my life should compliment me, not define me. And damnit if I want to listen to the Jigglypuff puff song while playing Star Wars the Old Republic after sending positive thoughts to friends and family and resting despite life’s many challenges that’s OK. 👍 

I’m still worthy and grateful and love all things.

AND

I will be periodically busting out an occasional cabbage patch dance when I am able! 🥳😁

I want to put my bubbly happy-go-lucky positivity out there for the world to be uplifted by instead of focusing on whatever else is out there.

I love you all sunshine beams 🧡☀️😊

Peace be the journey!"

the fact I'm able to think critically, the small artistic talent I've developed over the years,
my adorable pet budgies who always make me smile with their funny antics and fights, 
and finally... You. Every redditor who's given me the advice i needed, who helped me when i felt i had no one to talk to, who answered every one of my questions with kindness, so please remember to treat yourself every once and awhile and remember the thing i tell myself when anything brings me down.

kvuodtl,streetbarracuda55,18,,1711000796,happy," 1. I’m extremely happy for you! Having a great job and feeling fulfilled is incredible. 

But…

2. Life is not entirely about work. Yes, we need money, but you don’t have to work at specific places related to your college degree. Life throws you crazy curveballs, and you have no idea the twists and turns your career will take. Enjoy what you have, I’m so happy for you, but just know that a jobs come and go, and none of that is permanent. No one HAS to work a job for 50 years and be unhappy. We have some control over how we spend our time and we just gotta make the most of it"
kvvcl94,Farscape_rocked,6,,1711018431,happy," This is brilliant!

I recommend you write down / commit to memory why it's so good. Your job will become normal over time, and you might come to wonder about a change. It's good to be able to look back and remind yourself of why you loved it so much."
kvw4t8r,sacramentojoe1985,5,,1711031016,happy," Just FYI, as a 20 year old starting your career already, you have a great opportunity to set yourself up to not *have* to work for the next 50 years.

kvvr0hr,RinkyInky,2,,1711025670,happy, It’s easy to get over invested in work. After all it’s the thing you have to do 8hrs a day and probably have to think about over the weekends. Glad you found something that brings you joy. All the best and may better things come into your life.
kvwugig,streetbarracuda55,1,,1711039747,happy," You’re 15 years younger than me, so I felt like I could give the advice as someone who’s literally 15 years into their career. Have passion at your job, that’s great, but at the same time, layoffs happen, no reason for them sometime, management changes over night, direction shifts, coworker causes you of something, there’s a laundry list of things that can make work change in an instant. Hold onto what you got, keep being a good person and work hard, but keep a realistic perspective and ALWAYS look out for yourself. 👍🏻"

kvw8vb5,Southern_Rain_4464,7,,1711032458,happy," You know how sometimes early morning you hear a song and it gets ""stuck"" in your head all day?  

That is your subconcious and it is a powerful thing.  You might not even love the song but its just there.  

This works for happy thoughts as well.   Within just a few minutes of waking up if you watch 10 mins of ""happy videos"" you can implant happiness into your subconcious. 

For me its watching videos of bunnies, or children laughing.  Happy videos will vary from person to person.   As long as its a positive thing it works wonders. 

The best part is its free or you already paid for your phone and youtube has endless videos.  

Try it and see.   It works.  This is coming from a half century old man who was a  nihlist/misanthrope for ages.   That was basically  my default setting.  

Happy is objevtively better."
kvw3f19,methanegASS,5,,1711030517,happy," My key to general happiness is to take care of my body.

kvyo919,mmeveldkamp,1,,1711061642,happy," I wake up, say hi to Max (bunny) and make a good breakfast for both of us. Eat it on the couch while reading something or scrolling through some social media but only happy and funny stuff.

kvmk9fl,gymbunbae,8,,1710877737,happy," Thank you so much! And well, at first I was just trying to survive, using every bad habit under the sun to cope with the pain, but I slowly worked on accepting myself for who I am and processing my traumas, with the help of great friends who also accepted me for me. Drugs had shown me that I was capable of feeling happiness, which made me determined to figure out how to feel it without them. The most important thing for me during this journey was to accept, appreciate, and let go. Accept what I cannot change, appreciate all that is good, and let go of the bad. Life always has it's up's and down's, and that's the beauty of it, knowing that if I'm at a low, there's surely a high just around the corner. It also helped a lot to step away from my computer screen and interact more with the real world around me, focusing on hobbies that weren't just time sinks, but also benefit me in other ways, like physical activity and fixing up furniture!"

kvn0c4p,gymbunbae,3,,1710883094,happy," I went cold turkey on the nicotine and had a nicotine-free tobacco flavored vape to help me ditch the habit, I highly recommend this method as the habit is harder to ditch than the nicotine addiction, but the nicotine free vapes trains your brain to not associate fulfilling the habit with a reward. The first two weeks were the hardest, then it all just go easier from there as the withdrawals were over and I was slowly stabilizing and only had the mental dependency left to battle with."

kvpzujp,gymbunbae,1,,1710937093,happy," I just quit cold turkey and used a nicotine free vape to cope with urge of the habit, eventually the urge went away as my brain wasn't getting a reward for the habit anymore. Otherwise I just focused on replacing my bad habits with good ones, like being physically active instead of lazing around, or learning to cook instead of relying on junk, as well as spending my time trying out various hobbies!"

kvmcie6,gymbunbae,38,,1710875135,happy," Ooh, I'll be having my arms done too next month, haha! I had a quick and smooth recovery, I was back in the gym easing into my routine after only 3 weeks, no core workouts of course.

For the first couple of weeks I took strong painkillers, mostly slept, and had trouble just walking more than very short distances, I did however push myself to do as much as my body comfortably allowed me to, and made sure to lie down and rest immediately if I felt tired at all, and of course avoiding anything that caused pain. Somewhere around a week or two post-surgery I had my drains removed and chose to transition over to taking only paracetamol for pain management, I also chose to use my binder for longer than required simply because it felt more comfortable, as I had a lot of swelling, especially when I increased my activity levels."

I’m so happy for you, posts like this give people like me courage to keep going and not lose hope when life seems dull. Thank you for sharing! 
Although, I’m also scared that when this bad part of life gets over, and the happy part takes over, there is a lot of pressure to make that happy part last.. do you (or people seeing this comment) feel this also? Like for an example, after a shitty life and career, you get into your dream college in another country that can be life changing for you, but now, parallely you have also have found your “happily ever after” person but you have to leave them behind. It’s happy, but sad, but there’s also a pressure to elongate the happiness via LDR and planning for a future etc, but it’s actually heartbreaking?

kvph7x4,bethcano,1,,1710925653,happy, It's not for a little while yet as he had to start promoting the event and wasn't confident in his ability to keep it a total secret until the actual weekend - but I can get videos and photos! There's already a poster made up!
kvphcp9,bethcano,2,,1710925757,happy," Those adjectives perfectly describe him as a person - he's just the best! I would never want an explicit birthday party as I don't like all attention being on me, so this gig in secret honour is truly the best!"
kvphdwo,bethcano,1,,1710925784,happy," I'm more concerned about how I'm going to give him such an amazing birthday later on this year, haha!"
kvphp7d,bethcano,2,,1710926023,happy," They're 4 local ones, nothing that would really be known outside this area. Two haven't released anything, but the other two have and you can find them on Spotify: Ceejay (Force of Nature EP) and Gambling With Dogs (Take Me Back to Hammerfore single)."
kvphye3,bethcano,2,,1710926222,happy," He's absolutely incredible in every way - never loved anyone like I love him! Even when he's not doing these amazing big acts of love, he's always doing little things too that mean so much! 

But yeah, unfortunately the local music scene is on the decline. Ours is struggling a lot too - there's no support or money for originals bands, grassroots venues are closing. If you're able to, just find a random local gig one night and go to it! It's so much fun and you might stumble upon something you love. The bands he's booked are ones that sound incredible... but their music isn't out on any platform. You can only experience it live, and there's something magical in that!"

kvj908v,hiddentalent,2,,1710821501,happy," Man, I 100% get you on the observations about colors and food. It's amazing how bland and grey things get when you're in the grips of depression, and coming out of that is such a relief. I'm so happy for you and your family! Give your kids a hug. And when they're at the right age, which in my family was around 12-13, be very transparent with them about depression, how sneaks up on us, and how you'll always be there to help if they start to feel things going in that direction."

kvxuxe8,Impossible_Ant4708,1,,1711051626,happy, I need advice on this. I feel trapped
kvkh2i4,Donuts_please40,5,,1710850923,happy," Take whatever time it takes to fix yourself.  Don’t worry about anyone or anything else and just know there is no immediate fix.  I just posted in another comment that for me having a job I enjoy was the key.  Something where I don’t stress about going in the next day to any drama or any other BS.  Something where I NEVER bring anything home.  When I leave for the day or the weekend, then that’s exactly what I do.

Have someone, ANYONE who will be willing to listen.  I rely on my wife.  If I’m even just kinda grumpy I can tell her and explain why and she won’t judge at all.  Instead it’s “what can I do to help fix it”.  And now majority of the time it’s just so I don’t keep stuff bottled in.  If something is wrong I’ll air out whatever it is.  Even if it’s the most minor thing."
kvkf9dx,Donuts_please40,2,,1710850038,happy," Getting a job that I actually enjoy.  I have had over 30 jobs in my lifetime.  I’m 40.  But I always gauged success in how much I made.  If I wasn’t financially successful, I was useless to my family.  Realizing that just was not the case was huge.  I may not make a lot of money but they come home to someone who is happy, smiling, understanding, helpful.  I used to work in a hospital with my wife and they will sometimes announce a “code blue” which is that someone’s heart has flatlined and they need people there right away.  She told me when we worked together that every time that happened her heart would start racing, she would start sweating and just be terrified that it was me attempting to end my life.  She no longer has those worries."
kvkhjo0,Donuts_please40,2,,1710851150,happy," It’s crazy how different things are now.  It’s great.  And thanks for the tip with the kids.  Way ahead of you on that front though.  But I could not agree more.  Mine are 13 & 15 now and I have been VERY upfront and honest with them about my mental health and how I don’t care what they are going through, I will always be there for them."
kvzlbqu,Donuts_please40,1,,1711074210,happy, Feeling trapped how man.  What’s your story?  I can give insight on what worked for me.  Can’t guarantee it will work for you but just know you’re not alone man.  It’s rough.
kw0w65z,Historical-Market732,1,,1711102549,happy, Hans is definitely so adorable!
kvfcbns,Yellow-Cedar,2,,1710769787,happy," Beautiful. I have been lucky to live in such a place. I’d you are young-ish-make it happen! 
Water-indescribable happiness, water fowl? Even better as their habits fluctuate with migration so it’s always a joy to see who is there, fresh wind? Omg-marine habitat always has brilliant cloud scapes changing due to wind. 

I’m in a ‘nature dead’ space compared to my island/coastal life-in WA state. Here in Charlottesville VA because of grandkids .

Wind? Maybe 10 times a year. 
Water? A muddy, slimy lamprey filled river. 
Birds? One species of noisy peregrine falcon that just screeches and you never see it, but 1000 vultures all day every day. The only bird in the sky-from so many sea birds to this-is just sad. Oh. And 

The soil in young glacial wa was black and rich and full of growing ease, here-it hard, red, clay that dies all your clothing red. 

And Ticks. 
So, why!!?? 
I count my blessings, but -
If you can? Do. 💥🌹🍀🌈 and keep painting and dreaming!!"

My son (17m) got his girlfriend (15f) pregnant and it was not a fun time dealing with babies having babies. Lots of stress and family drama.  13 years later and my grandson is 100% my favorite person in the world. I'd fight a bear for him. He lives several states away but he spends his summers with us. 

Absolutely not what I would have wanted for my son at the time but I'm very grateful for my grandson. Give your daughter a hug from us. 😄"

kv8sdb4,DrFunkalupicus,2,,1710653132,happy, Not sure where it came from in this case! He came with the name from the cat shelter and my last cat’s name was Tigger…so two syllables and it ended with “we” so it felt familiar (we had lost Tigger due to cancer a few months before) so I rolled with it. Plus he was two at the time and orange cats aren’t the brightest so who knows what havoc I would have caused if I tried to change his name lol

kvduu18,Kyndrede_,1,,1710735937,happy," lol! That’s awesome. 

No idea how this saying came about between my wife and I. I think it related to making a hard search for something in the house. These days, we say a hard goog to refer to us doing a google search ourselves, vs a soft goog in which I get someone else to search it up for me xD"
kv6vchl,747-ppp-2,12,,1710622895,happy," For the OP and anyone else who cares, I’m 55 and my kids are gone, the BEST money I ever spent was athletic stuff for the boys.  I’d spend 50 bucks at Dunhams every spring for new cleats and socks.  I bought an entire Catcher set up a few years.  Hockey sticks were pricy and protein powder and gym memberships added up for sure….

My dad didn’t do shit with me and I still resent him for it but I vowed to have my kids prepared for any endeavor and showed them what that looks like.  When my older son was a senior in high school we still lifted together instead of his friends because “they didn’t go hard enough”

All that equipment turned into hours I wouldn’t trade for anything.  

2 days that stand out.  I was picking up son #2 from basketball and on my way to watch #1 play high school hockey and heard him score a goal on the radio.

A month later my uncle, my 95 year old grandfather and I watched my son play a high school baseball game and drank a whisky at the bar afterwards.

I am so glad I went all in."

kv6zmif,RedDit245610,12,,1710624547,happy," Prioritise yourself. She made you miserable and now leaving her makes you happy. Do not go back to her.

I really wouldn’t feel guilty if I were you, she’ll either grow and treat other people better or she’ll continue to find people to treat horribly. Either way she’ll be fine so it’s important that you don’t go back to her out of guilt.

With that being said I do think the guilt is more than normal for such a toxic relationship. Allow yourself to experience these emotions and don’t try to rush yourself to stop feeling guilty. Understand that it is more than ok to feel this way and a normal part of breaking up.

It makes me happy that you’re able to leave her. It can be hard to break away from these relationships, especially when they’re so toxic.

Make sure you continue to look after yourself 🫶"

kv2b841,TSBii,18,,1710543756,happy," It's good to have a direction.  I started law school when I was 39, and it seemed easier for us older students because we had some life experience to plug the law into.  That may be the case for you, too.  It helps if you know what kind of law you want to practice so you can pick useful electives.  Make sure to get an idea of what the bar exam in your state covers so you can make sure to learn those topics.  The best advice I received was from a lawyer at work who told me to guard my health.  Law school places big demands on time and energy.  The best warning I received was from one of the Jesuit priests who was a professor, who told us all that we should not argue with family or friends anymore because we were trained to win and it's not fair.  I found studying law to be exciting and very interesting.  I hope you will, too."

I've worked in colleges for a long time, mostly as a professor, and I'll tell you a secret: students like you who are older and have faced more hurdles on the journey to the college classroom are often my favorites. Don't doubt yourself. You might be surprised by how much of your life experience leads to academic success. And if you do doubt yourself, don't hesitate to reach out to your instructors, advisors, and what will undoubtedly be a whole support network at your college. They want you to thrive -- and you will."
kv2bxw3,Mutcd_hater,3,,1710544031,happy," Im more than excited and have a basic understanding of what everything entails. I genuinely have always found the law fun and excited I get to make it apart of my life. My favorite part about my current job is when we have proposals and contracts from contractors or engineering firms. And I’m the one who gets to dissect them to pieces and write reports on them for the big wigs. It’s like going to an amusement park for me and it’s not even 1/1000th of the real deal. 

Your story brought me comfort. I’ve been having almost like an imposter syndrome going on. Telling myself I’m gonna fail. Or I’ll get bored. When I know I won’t. But you helped clear a bunch of it out. My age was a concern. Because I’ll be in my 30s before I can start for my JD"

kv561tr,TSBii,2,,1710599753,happy, You are going to be very good.  I was working as a paralegal negotiating agreements and found that to be a great base to build on.  You have skills that students that go to law school right after undergrad studies won't gain for years.  You also have enough life experience that you won't mistake legality for morality.

This reminded me that I've improved the most important thing, which is the panic attacks. I used to have them a lot, similar to you - shaking, throwing up, being unable to stand up or speak or breathe. It felt so much like dying that I once ran into traffic because I felt one coming on and I just didn't want to go through another one. 

The most important thing I've achieved is better mental health. It's been tough, I had therapy for years, and I had a bad period where I was badly bullied in a job and the panic attacks came back for a while. I got out of that job, negotiated a severance, and got myself back up again. 

I'm not where I want to be right now, but I stopped the panic attacks. So you know what? I'm doing okay. Thanks for reminding me. Much love."

As time passes you will learn your body more, be able to feel okay sitting with uncomfortable thoughts or feelings, and regulating your nervous system.

Distractions help as well. And the more you have the more you will be able to spot the signs and work on it. I wish you luck my friend"
kuxfw7q,edhel_cosplay,3,,1710466405,happy, A few years ago I was in the same boat. I was miserable. There IS hope. I had many days where I couldn’t even get out of bed.

kv03app,edhel_cosplay,2,,1710515897,happy," That’s a HUGE thing to achieve!!!! To leave a negative space and built yourself back up mentally is in my opinion one of the hardest things to do as a human being. I think society puts so much pressure on us to “achieve” certain things and follow this rigid structure. I say fuck that, as long as you’re content with yourself and trying your best you haven’t wasted a single day of your life. Maybe we haven’t achieved the goals we wish we had, but that’s ok. We still have a lot of time left in our lives to restart, to try again, to keep moving forward. Please be kind to yourself, you probably have done more than you realize 🥹 I’m proud of you"

kunyq1b,wdjm,17,,1710331911,happy," The dog was a little too close - especially to the baby's face - in some scenes for my comfort, but your dog should absolutely be allowed to sniff your new infant and come close - *supervised*. That's how they develop the protective 'this is MY family' instincts instead of seeing the infant as an interloper they're supposed to tolerate being in their space.

But the trick is to also *limit how* they get close - for example not near the infants face - so that the dog also learns that, while the baby is their family, it is *your* baby. Much like a mother wolf will let other of the pack sniff & learn about her new pups, she will also *protect* those pups, even from others in the pack. Sniffing at baby's legs...maybe their bum...sure. Getting in baby's face...No.

I think where people mess up most often is not realizing that dogs just aren't people. That dog in the video is protective of the child and will absolutely, positively, never harm that child on purpose. HOWEVER...a nip that wouldn't reach past a healthy puppy's fur, could cause permanent scarring on more delicate human skin - especially infant skin. And dogs usually don't get that (some dogs seem to, but it's not something I'd want to depend on in all situations). They'll snap at an infant in the same way they'd snap at their own pups - not to injure, but to teach. Except the results are different for a human baby than they would be for a pup. A dog will lay a paw down on an unruly pup and smash it to the ground to calm it down. Instructive for the pup. Potentially bloody & scarring for a human child as dog claws rake down their skin. That's where the boundaries come in. Legs are fine to sniff, because if the nip happens there, it could be bad, but not horrific. Face is not. Cuddles are fine - but the dog stays near the feet, not the face.

I don't agree that dogs should never be let close to an infant...but parents should most definitely *manage* the interactions much more carefully than the video was showing."

Were my parents irresponsible? Maybe, but I literally always had a pit bull in my life until around 7, when we got a different type of dog. The pitbulls were the sweetest things, same as any of the other dogs we had. Never an incident. Never a growl. 

I'm a dog owner myself now, and I understand how cautious one must be when letting a dog interract with tiny humans. Would I make the same decisions my parents did? No. But that doesn't change the fact that Pits are just doggos. It's a catch 22, people get a  pitbull because of the stigma, and train it to be agressive. People who want agressive pits buy from owners with agressive pits. It's almost all the owners poor training. My parents pits were the best. I had a Chihuahua, and that little bastard bit quite a few people, and was very agressive. A much worse tempered dog, and there's plenty of acceptance for Chihuahuas."

kut6aic,EminemsBootyCheeks,-1,,1710407423,happy, Growin up with dogs is not the same as letting the dog lick baby's face tho
kuo4mkf,wdjm,7,,1710334585,happy," Different perspectives. If they only sniff clothing, but always get shooed away from the actual child, then the baby is something the parents are fully responsible for protecting and, while the dog probably won't attack the 'pack member', they also don't develop much of a relationship with the baby, either.

Allowing personal interaction on a very limited & supervised way gives the dog more connection to the baby and it will likely be more protective. Clothing just says 'this scent is normal here so the being it belongs to is fine to be here.' Associating that scent with the actual small, squirmy thing that is obviously a young, cues the more protective instincts - it's not just 'a creature that smells that way that the parents want to keep around,' it's a baby pack member.

And yes, all dogs are different and some may make the connection even from the clothing. But I'm also of the opinion that the acceptable behaviors - on both sides - needs to be taught from the start because there *will* be times the dog is around the baby, even for a moment, when the parents aren't. Whether it's by mistake or carelessness or simple necessity, it will happen as long as there is both baby & dog in the same household. The dog needs to learn how to interact with the baby...and even a young infant is capable of learning with gentle repetition that grabbing at dog fur is not acceptable behavior."

kuo2kkf,AelliotA1,2,,1710333699,happy," They're literally not the same, they're even recognised as separate by the KC. 

Staffies are known for being affectionate, pits are known for being strong willed and difficult to train with a lower threshold for violent behavior. 

The name ""Pitbull"" is often falsely used as a catch-all term for bully breeds but they are in fact very distinct from one another.

To be absolutely clear. I do not like pits either, and that's for a number of reasons. But don't turn that hate against this breed when they are not the same. The dangerous dogs act in the UK banned pits as a separate entity to staffies and staffies do not have an outsized impact on bite stats like pits do, hence are not subject to the same ban.

And that ban was effective in combating dog attacks until the emergence of ""XL bullys"" which themselves have been characterized as a distinct and now banned breed.

So if staffies are the same as you claim then why did the bite stats not stay high during the entire time that staffies have been completely legal to own and get themselves put on the ban list?"

It takes the same skills and empathy to raise a pit bull as any other dog. You just have to buy from a reputable breeder and vet the parents. 

Some pits have been bred and selected for fighting and being agressive. Others haven't. I wish people got to meet my childhood friends, they were honestly the best.

We had multiple instance of drivers being mauled by Goldens. The only thing that saved my ass was being properly trained on how to deal with the situation. We had one guy that had to stab one in the neck to get it off of him. 

I was attacked by pitbuls too, but let's not pretend that Goldens won't maul someone they perceive as a threat to their people. Every instance was the same. The top 3 scariest attacks I had were Goldens near their owner. They were less suseptive to my defenses than any other encounter.

I understand that Goldens are generally less agressive, but its statements like ""just get a golden"" that lead to shitty owners, not properly training their dogs assuming they're some special breed.

Case in point, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread this dog in the video isn't a pit yet people are going on ranting about the breed.

They are awesome dogs. That doesn’t change the fact there are tons of stories and instances of “family dogs” that never gave an indication of hurting fly snapping and killing an infant.

I have the same stance with Doberman’s, Rottweilers, Great white Pyrenees, and basically every breed over a certain weight.

Pit Bulls are unique in that if they snap, their body composition, instincts, and jaw strength add up to a very dangerous situation.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t ever have a pit, just that there are too many careless owners who need to be more careful with young kids.

Kids are stupid. They will slap, grab, hit, and can scare dogs easily.

No need to get so defensive, Pits are great dogs, just it’s a fact they account for the overwhelming majority of fatalities involving children and dogs."

So, in response to what you've said, I wonder then of the relative importance of genotype vs. phenotype. If other breeds are getting lumped with pit bulls, perhaps we need to investigate whether certain phenotypical traits are better predictors of injuries and fatalities versus specific genotypes corresponding to individual breeds, or perhaps a combination of both. I say this because the lumping of other breeds with pitbulls suggests they are visually similar and if visually similar dog breeds are doing the attacking then maybe phenotype is a crucial factor. 

Hopefully a biologist reads this and can critique this idea."
kuonk11,Levita97,-9,,1710341712,happy," Larger dogs definitely can cause more damage, but my point still stands. Especially when we’re talking about babies and small kids. A smaller dog can still do a whole lot damage to small human."

Shitty people often get these types of breeds *because of the stigma* and train them to be agressive by abusing the dog. Others see these types of dogs in videos or statistics and draw conclusions about the dog, but it's just acting that way because it was abused. I hate it. 

I agree that pits are powerful creatures, they can absolutely cause damage if they want to. So could a human man though, and more human men have harmed humans than any dog, by an insane margine.  Probability wise, I'm far more likely to be hurt by the man handling a pitbull than the pitbull itself. I also understand that if I act normally, and give people/ dogs thier space, nothing bad is likely to happen. 

Kids absolutely are stupid, my brother used to throw shit at our pit, try to draw on it with crayons, do generally dumb kid shit. The pitbull took it in stride, never showing any signs of aggression. You could say it was just a good tempered pit, and it was absolutely poor parenting, but all our dogs were like that. Except for the chihuahua, he was just an asshole."

The evidence behind the “no one knows what a pit bull looks like” talking point consists of multiple studies done on the same population of 20 mixed-breed dogs, a sample that included only two dogs with any pit bull ancestry. [These studies have been roundly torn apart in court](https://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/doubert-motion-to-exclude-experts-redacted-10-25-2021.pdf): For one, [these studies expected participants to “correctly” identify dogs as pit bulls even if the dog had only one pit bull great grandparent, meaning that dog is only 12.5 percent pit bull or is seven-eighths / 87.5 percent NOT pit bull.](https://www.fuhrmanclinic.com/blog/pit-bulls-10)

In “[the largest sampling of shelter dogs’ breed identities to date](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202633),” participants were generally able to correctly identify dogs with more than 25-30 percent pit bull ancestry. Participants were also far more likely to label a pit bull as a non-pit bull than vice versa and higher pit bull ancestry correlated with higher ID accuracy: “**we found that as the number of pit bull-type relatives in a dog’s heritage increased, so did the shelter’s ability to match the results of DNA analysis.**” Gunter LM, Barber RT, Wynne CDL (2018) [A canine identity crisis: Genetic breed heritage testing of shelter dogs.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202633) PLoS ONE 13(8).

kuslcop,Warm_Water_5480,0,,1710392707,happy," Honestly, still human males. The agressive pitbulls would be killed more or less, or retreat into less inhabited areas. The less agressive pitbulls would be tolerated and naturally selected for. The biggest issue of a massive unchecked dog population would be rabies. There would also be plenty of bites, but that's true of any unchecked dog population, regardless of breed. See places like India or Thailand, where stray dogs are just part of life (and not pitbulls).

The key is training, and that's true of any breed. I don't buy into the pitbull hate, because every single pitbull I've ever known has been a super friendly dog. I've been bitten by labs and other breeds. I'm willing to bet that most people who say pitbulls are aggressive have never actually interracted with a pitbull. I'm sure people get bit, and that sucks, I wish the owners would have been responsible. Any responsible owner wouldn't let their pet who's shown signs of aggression get into a situation where they could bite. It's always the owners fault, straight from the day they got to the dog to the day it bit. Training is hard, and not just anyone should get a dog. 

Edit: it's also the breeders fault, any pitbull that's aggressive should not be allowed to breed."

Often I would say no to food and my friends or family would be like ""Oh come on, one won't hurt"". It gets easier to say no, and the deficit becomes normal. Now I can't eat even half the food I would have a couple years ago. Calorie counting sucks, it gets easier, but temptations and guilt were always there for me.

One day I was downtown running errands and, after getting some bad news, I just leaned against my car dejected and panicky and about to cry. And nice older lady walked up to me and said ""honey, you look like you could use a donut"" and opened up a big box of beautiful artisan donuts from a place I had been wanting to try but hadn't had the time. I picked one, said thank you so much, and sat in my car crying slightly manic happy tears eating it. It was so good. I'll never forget donut lady. If I believed in guardian angels, I think she would be mine."

ku6m3kg,raikenleo,12,,1710049212,happy," I have a friend who I really love and even though ik what I'm going to say is the bare minimum but she is someone who has always listened to whatever pain I come to her with. She has always always been there for me. The only person in my life I immediately think of whether I'm in pain or happy because she is worth sharing both with. I have never once been betrayed by her or deceived or manipulated which for most would be a low bar but to me she feels like a sacred treasure. 

The one honest loving person who doesn't look at me in disgust. Someone who hears my pain and someone who helps me get back up. It's not like I don't return the favour but I am so fucking grateful she exists in my life. I would genuinely have nothing if she wasn't there. Everyone else around me... Are either monsters or people wearing facades. 

She is the only one that feels human."

Single mom, car motor blew- went to a local dealer who gave me a car with the promise and paperwork I would bring back the down payment in 2 weeks. Now if I didn't there would be a warrant for my arrest. 

Took the offer, Got a job waiting tables started that night and got the money back to him.

 He's dead and gone now but I still think of his kindness and know my life would have went very differently without that car."

Just about another year left (I went PT at first for my MA). Best of luck and it will be an AMAZING feeling when you finally get your degree! You should feel so proud of yourself! :)"

ku6087u,knitpicky,3,,1710038660,happy," The good people to surround yourself with don't care about how long it took you to get around to college; they care about the story--how you grew, how you adapted, how you loved yourself. Your friend you texted can see you had it in you all along. Thanks for sharing what he sees with us! You got this! "

ktzzcbq,Partypaca,1,,1709943954,happy," Happy for you, but don't assume getting a degree will do much nowadays. A trade is far more valuable and easier to obtain. Many things also don't require schooling. You can self teach yourself many things that can be utilized into a career. It's more nuanced but its becoming a lot more normalized."
ku76ovr,sunglassesonmydick,1,,1710063027,happy," I’m excited for you!!! I’m 31 and just graduated with my bachelor’s. School is so much fun when you’re old tbh.

ktzb4rc,Zarine_Aybara,3,,1709934827,happy, I’m in the middle. Two implants placed and healing for crowns to be placed in four months time. And a molar extraction healing. Man it’s costing a bundle but worth it in the long run.
ktzjk2o,anthroadam,3,,1709937822,happy, Very happy for you. Hoping you can keep moving forward with better days ahead. I was in a similar situation recently.
ku0dno9,kath_or_kate,3,,1709949814,happy, Congratulations!! & glad you are feeling better
ku3asrs,Dependent-Square5571,3,,1710002698,happy," I know that feeling so well. Been through 12 cavities and a root canal, and I'm 1 day out from getting my wisdom teeth removed. Finding a dentist who is patient and kind about your fears changes everything! I still hate the noises and sensations, but I know that they'll take things at my pace. good for you :) and congrats on getting all of it done !"
ku8g7wc,Glowing102,2,,1710086787,happy," That's amazing! Well done! 🎉
I'm in the same boat.
Haven't been to the dentist for 18 months despite knowing I need a root canal and 2 implants.
I went last week and am booked in for my root canal in a few weeks time.
My dentist said he'd noticed I was flinching less than I used to.
I've been having therapy to reduce my anxiety levels and I think it must be working! 😊
Can't wait to be able to eat comfortably again."
ktzg2hi,pfemme2,4,,1709936558,happy," Good for you!! It’s so worth it. Also, I was surprised to find that dentistry has come a pretty long way in my few years of absence. A lot of things that used to take a long time or be more painful are easier and quicker now. Almost every single procedure, including the cleaning, was less awful than I had thought it would be. You can do it!"
ktzfpjq,pfemme2,2,,1709936432,happy," On the one hand, I am sorry you have to go through all of that. Especially the implants. I’m so fearful about having to have one, but I understand that, as I age, I will probably end up needing one someday. But on the other hand, it sounds like you have gotten through probably the roughest parts. I did that, too. I did the two root canals first, and I think that made it easier to keep pushing forward to finish everything else. Because I knew each thing after that would be easier than the thing before it, and I was right. Good for you and keep it up."
ktzytta,pfemme2,1,,1709943747,happy, Thank you. I’m also happy for you for getting free of it.
ku0lk40,pfemme2,3,,1709953088,happy," Thank you! I had been having terrible sensitivity to heat, cold, and anything acidic for months. Of course, I knew something was very badly wrong, but I kept putting it off, in part for good reason—I had a trip to accomplish, and when I got back after the New Year, I wasn’t going to put any of it off any longer, and I did not. But it really is hard to schedule all of this kind of thing around work and travel and the like. Anyway, for months and months before I got this work done, I couldn’t eat hot soup or drink cold water, or even eat certain fruits. I definitely knew something was very wrong and that I was risking a serious infection."
ku1hqg0,Zarine_Aybara,3,,1709969543,happy, Please remember to take care with the rootcanal teeth. They are technically dead now so don’t chew hard stuff on them to prevent chipping.
ku369o8,pfemme2,2,,1710001141,happy, Yes!
ku8glj4,Glowing102,1,,1710086924,happy," I wish my dentist had told me this.
1 expensive root canal with anaesthetic, plus 2 crowns which have both cracked ... now left with a big gap in back of mouth ... I think all up it cost 2 or 3k."

ktz7cbj,guitarnautical,1,,1709933530,happy," Playing strategy games can translate into thinking strategically about making life decisions. You can think of every decision and action you make in life as if you're moving a pawn or a bishop or any other game piece on the board. Every day I went to the gym, it was like I was moving a pawn piece in a game of chess. Strategically, I increased my time and increased the number of times per day I'd be at the gym, so I could get more gains sooner.

ktttczm,giraffield,-9,,1709848632,happy," This is gonna get downvoted. I just want to point something out, saying ""I've been missing out"" by not dating white guys is casual racism. It implies white guys are better, and simultaneously that whichever other races she dated previously were flawed because of their race. At the same time THIS white guy might be better than her previous relationships or dates, it's just not because he is white. 

I feel like she does not intend that. She seems like a nice person who values the things this man offers, his race shouldn't be part of the discussion."
ktusn50,talkintater,-6,,1709862828,happy," All she talks about is what he has and what he could do for her, sprinkled with casual racism. This is not wholesome. This red flag material.

Her first date at 22 though? Girl waited!"
kttw7b8,fuzzyshorts,17,,1709849591,happy," that white guy was an exceptional fella... black OR white. Bought his own house, doing renovations by himself (hanging barn doors ain't 101 carpentry)  and owns his own 2021 vehicle (with a screen! I don't have a screen!). Plus NO ONE is coming up with the ""thrifting outfits for the next date"" schtick!

ktu4srj,Lovemindful,6,,1709852586,happy, 25 is definitely enough time to buy and house and a car. It all depends on your life path. At 25 I was giving people anesthesia and made enough money to buy both.

His car was newish but that doesn't mean new, it may be $20k, car payments are an option. This is not that farfetched."

ktr1xna,proo27,1,,1709810173,happy," Unfortunately no. That guy broke my heart into pieces. We went into a relationship and he was super controlling and didn’t acknowledge my goals and ambitions I had for life. He made me feel miserable when I was starting my masters in a foreign country. I went there on scholarship and he told me to leave that and stay with him because my education isn’t important enough. After suffering for a few months , I broke up with him. It’s the best decision I took, cause after a year, I met my current fiance. And he is everything I wished for and more. Never disrespected me, controlled me, always inspired me to achieve my goals and so on. I guess if I didn’t suffer enough in that previous relationship, I wouldn’t be matured enough to understand what I deserve. And I’d never say yes to my current fiance cause I always went for red flags before- Guys who lovebombs, controls me and there’s chase to get validation. I’m so happy I’m past this phase of my life. And got to value men who are actually nice human beings."

ktqxohr,Ch1cken3,2,,1709807308,happy, Sounds perfect then. To be honest I'm a little jealous because my boyfriend and I aren't able to move in together yet. Hopefully it happens sooner rather than later. 😅 Still though glad for you and hope it all goes well with the move and job hunt.

We truly are each others’ best friend and we recognize how fortunate we are for that! It’s really wild to watch your person go from a freshman in college to kicking ass in a challenging career they’re passionate about, something we’re both lucky to be experiencing. We bought our first house a couple years ago, and we take time to cherish the small moments, like picking out paint samples this past weekend and tending to our gardens. For me, he is home and I’m confident we’ll only continue to build on our solid foundation! Sorry if that’s too mushy! 😅"

I think your positivity will open a lot of doors for you. 

My best advice (even though I know you didn’t ask!) is to try to really understand what your coworkers expectations are of you, and don’t make the mistake I did of focusing on my expectations of myself in the role instead of clarifying what theirs were. Once I figured that out everything started running much more smoothly. 

Slow and steady! You got this!

One thing I do to boost my mental health is dedicate 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening to my face and mouth. This includes a careful dental routine and a simple but effective skincare routine. After doing these things I feel so much cleaner and healthier, and I like that I can look in the mirror afterwards and physically see how my efforts have helped me. It's a nice and easy way to build in self care and respect for my long term health."

I didn't know the competitive gaming could cause such strife but it makes sense. 
Thank you for reminding me that I want to reduce my social media time. I DO spend a tiny bit on Insta but I am happier when i reduce my use with it. I DON use reddit but I feel it has insightful nuggets of information that I come across. As far as eating, I will consider getting vitamins. I'm vegetarian so I have to be careful about that stuff. I'm an unfortunate homebody but I agree with you: staying home too much is unhealthy. My goal is to go out at least twice a week. If you're only 22 are realizing all these things you are already way ahead of the curve and great job on your self reflection. I commend you 👏"

I can’t wait to also be able to spend more time with my daughter. Working 9-5 then coming home and studying until 8 usually only gave me enough time to give her dinner/ a bath then put her to bed."

ksz6dzy,mck-_-,8,,1709367508,happy," You gave been awake for 36 hours? Are there times you feel down at all? Have you considered maybe bipolar episodes?
I don’t think you mean psychopath but more sociopath, but that wouldn’t make you happy. Sociopaths are unable to feel empathy and it varies greatly but mostly they aren’t super happy, they just don’t really care about others and go through life putting on a mask of being normal because that’s what makes them socially acceptable. I read about a man who was a sociopath and lived a completely normal life and then his son came to him and said he thought he was one and the man helped him to pretend to be normal. He wasn’t really bothered by it, he just thought it was interesting how he was different. Supposedly they are a lot more common than recorded because most don’t come forward because it’s not really a problem for them."
kt016qh,arbol98,3,,1709387675,happy," I’m a psychiatric nurse and second the comment about bipolar disorder. Not sleeping and being in a great mood is associated with hypomania and mania. Look into both of those and also ask your loved ones to let you know if they notice any changes in your behavior if you continue to not sleep the next few days. At this stage it may not seem like a problem but if lack of sleep continues, risks of danger increase. Plus Folks experiencing hypomania or mania often aren’t aware of changes because of their great mood. I would suggest finding a psychiatrist just to have a professional rule it out, and if your loved ones believe you need help right away, an ER in your area can help connect you with safe resources sooner. The disorder is very treatable. Not trying to startle you, but do want you to continue to monitor as you correctly pointed out that this pattern is different from what is expected with sleep deprivation. Happy to answer any questions you may have! Great insights into your mood by the way, that self awareness is awesome to see"
kt27o8c,Wild_Nectarine666,2,,1709416584,happy," This sounds like me when I’m having a manic episode. Have you consulted with a doctor? I’m not trying to be condescending at all fyi! I just know that with the highs of mania come some serious consequences and lows, and if a caution from a stranger can prevent someone else from struggling as I did, I gotta say something :) <3"

ksswesl,Hatrick_Swaze,5,,1709264467,happy," The life of a dog is a sight to behold...

From the heavens above, loaned us these hearts of pure gold...

They hit the ground running, and barking with us....

For the joy we both share, builds an unbreakable trust...

The love from a dog is like candy from a box...

You're not sure what to pick, but there's never one wrong.

A dogs life with us is such a short, joyous trip...

But the life they share with us, is our deepest friendship...

It hurts when they leave, because we always want more time...

Our dogs know their destiny...hence why they always play and pine...

So don't be bothered...when they come boop your hand... 

They just know their hour glass, is running out of sand.

Just look into those beautiful, sparkling eyes...you fell for before...

And get up and reach for that leash, thats hanging by the door. 

They'll enjoy that walk with you, even though they're hurt and can't see...

Because the time spent with you, is the place they long to be. 

So remember this when your dog asks for your time...

Your dog is just doing what heaven asked them to do...

And that's ...make your heart shine. 

Too💛"

This has been proven in peer reviewed journals you can look up. AAPI’s are often excluded or categorized as “other” in critical studies of crime and carcerality.

ksrjy6o,ForrestCFB,1,,1709245758,happy," Yeah, he is right after how you worded your comment though. 

Your reasoning is wrong, it's not that someone thought atleast after the 60's ""hey lets fuck minorities over for slave labour"" it's more that the institutional consequences of years and years of racist legislation is still there. Just look at the ""ghetto"" problems for instance, that's a result of poor urban planning, the witholding of opportunities and programs and even outright ban black people from owning property in white neighborhoods. 

People are still responsible for their own actions, they are in jail (putting bail and justice system aside because that opens a whole other can of works) because they did something illegal. That's not racist, that's just priviliged and uninformed or a bit more serious, misinformation or desinformation. 

It's just that they were fucked over by society and the question ""what would we do if in the same situation"" should be asked. Pretty difficult to fix though, it's terrifying to see how 60 year old legislation (that PRIMARILY caused this, more recent legislation didn't really cause it but failed to fix it) has such far reaching consequences today."

ksqqhty,b00bie3,1,,1709236079,happy," it was never an argument, just wanted to add my thoughts. I don’t think that what you are saying applies though, in this situation I see a human being who worked very hard when he shouldn’t have for 13¢ to send money that may not even make it to the people who are suffering because that’s all he could do. Is it right, no. Does he have a kind heart, absolutely. I’m not sure how two things can’t be true in this situation?

ksy4evr,peace_peace_peace,2,,1709346430,happy," Hey I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be a jerk.  I forget that maybe people who haven’t experienced shocking death probably just have a dramatically different perspective on just about everything.  I can’t remember what it felt like before, but I experience the horror of death so immediately when it’s mentioned, it becomes the only thing in the room, so to speak.  So in a subreddit literally called “happy,” it makes me feel like an absolute alien to see that a post like this could make anyone “happy.”  It’s genuinely shocking.  But I’m just one person wasting my time arguing, you’re right, and once again, sorry gor being a dick. Have a nice night."

I guess the one thing I would like to ask is how you feel about trans women competing in women's sports?

It seems like the people we see arguing for it on TV and such are often very dogmatic in regards to trans women are women so of course they should be able to compete against other women, and not acknowledging the potential advantage they might have. 

I'm interested to hear what your opinion is on the topic and what you know about the general consensus on the issue in the trans community."

how does changing your outward appearance make you happier? Wouldn’t changing your inside thoughts and being able to love yourself as you are be the way to make yourself happy?  

I have just always been curious about this and have never had the opportunity to ask anyone. 

It seems like we are in an era of self love and love who are and be yourself, but that so often involves changing who you are. Which doesnt make sense to me."

Do you miss anything from your life ‘previous chapter’? 

Sorry if it’s a sensitive topic just ignore everything.

All the best!"

Before you transitioned we seem to have had a similar color and denseness of beard.

I’m hoping to be starting soon, how long did it take you to deal with the beard and were you able to do laser at all with the color or did you have to go full electrolysis?"

I've been deconstructing my ideas of sexuality and gender, and I'm gay. My question is how would you suggest I find out if I actually am a woman or I'm just a gay man that wishes I could be a woman because I feel it would be easier for dating?"

kslokd0,wl-dv,-1,,1709157406,happy," Do you ever feel weird about the fact that genitalia grew out of you and that was just “how it is” from there on out? —autistic question my apologies if it’s too weird, but! due to autism I don’t really identify with my genitalia but I do say I’m the same as I was born, although I personally identify with neither— 

anyway, onto a more normal question, do you think that the difference in hormones (if you do all that) makes you think differently? I’ve been wildly curious of this due to the young age hormone therapy. I get worried lil babies brains won’t develop “”correctly”” cause the hormones are different than their brains original setup was, and may not be what they need to reach full development. If it doesn’t change how you think much, it’s either because you hit “25” already, or it’s not something to worry about. :b 

Thanks for being open! I’ve had these questions for many years and haven’t have anyone to ask lol"

How and when did u find out that you are trans?
How did u cope wid it ?
When and what happened that you decided thaf you will go thru wid the surgery and the treatment?

And the scar i mean the chest scar, does dat hurt? What if the wound opens up? Does dat happens?

And i heard that specifically trans fem have to do a lot more then just surgery and hormones to pass as a female, what do they mean by that? And how ?

Thanks a lot! I have a few more but these i guess are enuf for now.

I do have several guy friends who once I was far along enough in my journey did try to hook up with me.  I didn't felt fetishized, necessarily.  Fetishization occurs when the person attached to body is removed.  They still saw me for who I am, but were simply attracted to my femininity at that point.

Either way, the pain was excrutiating for the first few days.  After that, it was more of a mental battle.  It took me well over a year before I could function back to personal standard.  Unfortunately, I do still have some occassional minor pain where a titanium plate rests.

Throughout my teenage years, the progression was significant.  I knew something was wrong and knew I wanted to be a woman, but I didn't know that it was \*possible\* to transition.  I grew up in a very conservative part of the US, and the only representation I saw of transgender women was through pornography.  In fact, it didn't occur to me at that time that there was such thing as a transgender men.  I \*only\* saw transgender women through sick fetishization. 

When I moved to a more liberal part of the country to get my master's degree, I met a trans woman who taught graduate-level biology.  I met a trans woman who practiced family law.  I met a trans woman who served as a primary care physician.  I met a trans woman who toured with a band playing the bass guitar.  Once I realized that you could transition from male to female while living a more socially reserved life, I almost immediately started my medical journey.

In terms of what felt wrong, that's hard to place a finger on.  My body felt wrong.  When I looked in the mirror, it felt like I was looking at my twin.  Not myself.  I felt repulsed by the parts of my male biology.  And I longed, deeply and profoundly, to escape from... something."

However I would be very interested to hear how that works in reality, from a person who's experienced it! OP, please forgive me if my assumption is incorrect."

Facial hair doesn't stop growing from hormones, once a hair follicles activate for a male puberty hair will be produced regardless of your hormones. The different hormones will effect the growth rate and thickness though. Most trans women will opt for laser hair removal or electrolysis in order to remove hair."
ksnk67n,OhGarraty,2,,1709183303,happy," Estrogen and testosterone don't like to exist in harmony. One will tend to dominate the other. And you do need some sex hormone for bone health.

But not a lot of it. You can suppress testosterone and take a smaller amount of estrogen to slow the effects. You could even at some point stop suppressing testosterone and stop taking estrogen to reverse most of those effects. Then cycle back on estrogen for a while, etc. So to answer your question, kind of.

A word of warning, doing that might feel a bit unpleasant. Or it might not. Depends on what you take, dosage, individual biology, how much you enjoy the changes, etc."

ksx37zu,Pattystr,2,,1709331721,happy," Mama, it’s hard to let go of some of your attachment to the child You once knew as your little boy.  She was always your daughter, and it just took her a while to realize that. Give yourself some grace and some time to adjust. Educate yourself and surround yourself with people who can be supportive. There are a ton of resources in every area if you look for them.  

My daughter is transgender and thriving and happy. I hate with every fiber of my being that my initial internal response was one of fear and sadness. It did not take me long once I began educating myself, and seeing my daughter grow in to herself to adjust my perspective. Now, I just consider myself incredibly luckyto be the parent of the most amazing child who is honestly still just themselves! She has not changed one bit except for her gender.

If you (not you specifically but people in general) can’t step back and forget about themselves long enough to be there for their friend and root and cheer them on then they are just selfish a-holes that don’t deserve the friendship they aren’t supportive of. My philosophy on that is if someone wants to be in my life, it should be unconditionally. I didn’t ask them to be there and if they are going to put stipulations or fine print on our relationship then they have shown me that they don’t really care about me and I don’t need people like that in my life. You deserve nothing less than greatness and people who can’t get on board with that don’t deserve to be in the same room as you, let alone be involved in your life. ❤️"

Please forgive these examples if they seem trite, but did you have interests that those around you wouldn't accept you having while being a man?

ksm7y7a,30phil1,5,,1709164101,happy," As someone who's planning on starting the whole process soon, I'd love if you could go more into detail. Specifically...

What did each individual facial feminization surgery actually do? How spaced out were they from each other?

Do you happen to have a picture of what your face looked like pre-FFS but post-beard? Since you're so far along the process, it's hard to figure out what the difference was (then again, I guess that's what r/transtimelines is for).

What did your doctors say about getting the surgery to begin with? I've spoken with some and they said that you have to be on HRT for at least a year and even then it's not necessarily recommended for everyone.

And lastly, does FaceID still work after you had everything done?"
ksky7f4,ManSpaniel_,4,,1709148991,happy," Yeah the trans people I've known didn't have surgery, well one did but sadly he passed not long after his top surgery so didn't have change to properly catch up with him"

kspvjvd,1molwAter,3,,1709225915,happy," I hope the following answer both yours and the original commenter’s question. 

First, body dysmorphia is about perceived flaws that is disproportionate to the reality. 
Anyone can have body dysmorphia. It causes the patient to be hyper fixated on their perceived flaws of their appearance even to others, they look completely normal, or the flaw just doesn’t really exist. 
Remember the nature of body dysmorphia, it is not really a reflection of reality. By nature, you don’t really have to HAVE a problem to THINK you have a problem. Then, how can you “fix” and be happy with it? The danger of body dysmorphia lies right here. You can fix it, get plastic surgery, but you’ll find other “flaws” of yourself to be anxious about. That’s why it’s a mental disorder not something you can fix with plastic surgery, like “I never liked my nose since I was a kid so when I grew up I got plastic surgery now I’m much happier and more confident”. 

Body dysmorphia however, it will provide you with infinite number of problems to fix, without treatment, can often lead to dangerous medical outcomes. It is a mental illness that requires medical intervention!


Second, body dysmorphia does not have a relationship with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is NOT a mental illness. Gender dysphoria is something you can find an end to, you can transition to your identified gender and live happy, fixing “problems” provided by body dysmorphia is a never ending hole. If something does not interfere with your ability to live a life, have stable relationship, be healthy, it is NOT an ILLNESS. That’s why not liking some feature of yours is not a mental illness. Even having fetishes is also not an illness, as long as you can keep it in your bedroom. 

Even gender dysphoria is included in the DSM but wether it’s a mental disorder is debated. Which means, not only is it not an illness in psychiatry researchers debate if it’s even mental or not. Some believe it might have biological cause, which means, if true then you’re just “born this way”. 

Remember, we are meat machines with codes. Although super complicated, our thoughts are electrical signals and our parts are coded with instructions. If you’re programmed this way, blindly promoting self love and acceptance will do more harm than good. Us as humans, the beauty of our intelligence is to use tools. We are all about not settling with what we are born with and what we are given. Better yourself and love yourself at the same time. 

Hope this helps.

ksm05va,ethanholmes2001,1,,1709161275,happy," Typical mental health stems from a brain problem, not a body problem.

It’s the only thing where a person’s own diagnosis and solution to their personal diagnosis is taken as truth.

For example, if someone has a fear of the swimming pool because of sharks, the solution would not be training them to fight sharks. The real solution is affirming that there are no sharks in the water at all."

&#x200B;

I know very, very little about transitioning. And, even though I had heard the term ""facial feminization"" surgery in plastic surgery forums, I had no idea what it entailed.

I thought it was a generic term for regular procedures (like nose job, upper bleph etc...) meant to give more delicate features but I had no idea that they were so involved, physically traumatic and distinct.

It looks absolutely brutal. BRUTAL.

And the fact that you would be willing to go through all that again gives me a greater understanding of what you must have been feeling like prior to the procedure and how important it must have been for own well being.

I appreciate you being so candid. I am glad to have learnt something new."
ksmz73y,DVsKat,2,,1709174206,happy," Okay so I guess a more relevant question is this: I assume you had to suddenly learn a lot about more feminine styles, like hairstyles and clothing, etc, in a relatively short amount of time. How did you accomplish this?

It also took me over two years to fully move from my men’s wardrobe to my women’s. It took a lot of baby steps to muster the courage and find what felt comfortable. 

What catalyzed things for me was landing a job as a manager of a law firm. It paid well, which let me build a wardrobe and also required me to dress professionally."

ksl6ipx,WaffleStomperGirl,2,,1709151714,happy," As another person who has been there, walks are great. The fresh air, the sun, smells of nature. But also it’s something I can do without owing anyone any explanation - if I want to go home after only a few minutes, I can. If I want to spend longer, I can. I can decide what direction I go, and how fast I decide to do so. 

All of these factors are really good to think about, at least for me, when I’m in that deep dark pit. Because they’re factors of controlling the situation. It removes a lot of the barriers for me. Maybe that’s specific to me, but maybe it’ll help someone else, too. 

Either way, good job. 

Depression is a monster some of us must do battle with. Remember that you’re not alone. Depression changes how we see things and tints everything. But you’re still here. And you’re learning to fight it. 

You can do this. 
Many of us have been exactly where you are. And by taking those steps outside you kicked depression in the face. And when you’re ready, you’ll do it again. And someday soon, depression will lose its hold on you, and fighting it will get easier. 

You’ve got this."

It’s so important to remember you don’t have to go.. climb a literal mountain. We all have our own mountains for our own reasons. You have to take it at your own pace. 

Standing outside even for a minute or so, if that’s where you’re at, is perfectly fine. When you’re ready, you’ll do it again. And each time you do, it gets easier and easier. And if that’s all you end up doing, then that’s perfectly fine. You’re telling depression to get F’d, and that’s what matters."

ksggvv3,K_Star444,2,,1709078109,happy, It reminded me of my days in Missouri during the spring! I guess cold can be a little subjective. Haha for me 58 is cold but that’s bc I am in 70s weather year-round!
ksh4b2x,,2,,1709086785,happy," I feel you. Yea its hard. I used to get depressed for no reason, unable to get out of bed or do anything. Now its more just, anxiety of being around people. When it’s anonymous, its easy. The sunglasses help alot, out in public. Feels like a mask."
ksgh6jb,,1,,1709078220,happy, Thats fair. Its been less than 30 the last few months.
ksh56hs,No-Use-3062,2,,1709087108,happy," Yep. Sometimes I isolate myself for long periods and when I do go out the social anxiety can be pretty bad. I think it’s a thing that we have to practice and maybe one day our fears won’t seem that bad. In fact when I was in my early twenties my doctor suggested that I just immerse myself into the public. So, I got a job at a local casino and all of a sudden I had to talk with all sorts of people.  I found that I was actually pretty good at it and even had a few girlfriends over my twelve years I was there."
ksh5vtc,,2,,1709087367,happy," Yea practice is definitely necessary. When im working, im a social butterfly, but i get laid off for the winter and basically just hibernate until work starts back up. I think a girlfriend would be nice but i believe i need to love myself before loving someone else. Also, working at a casino must have been interesting. Id probably just gamble away all my earnings."
ksh7do0,No-Use-3062,2,,1709087927,happy," lol you know dude I did develop a pretty bad gambling problem over those years. Also, my coworkers were straight up alcoholics. Luckily I never did drink too much but it was unhealthy in those regards. It still broke some barriers for me."

Even now, all my extra money and resources are going to building a cattery (thankfully I have a lot of handy friends so I only need to afford the materials, and even then not many) so I can help house a bunch of ferals as we get them fixed, checked out, and some of the younger ones rehomed!"

What if they’re over staffed and management is struggling to find hours for everyone? OP taking the day off would give someone else some hours.

krpdeor,WaffleStomperGirl,20,,1708654510,happy," As someone who is 40+, a sociologist, and with three kids who are now moved out, I feel I can hopefully fill in some blanks here; 

About 15 years ago, it seems, texting took a major step forward in primary conversation for young people. At this point it is far preferable to calling. 

There’s a lot of reasons for the change, but it’s enough to simply point out that the change happened. Though, honorable mention to online dating. 

With that, in the last 7-8 years (guesstimate) that took another leap forward and intimate conversations now often happen via text. 

Agree with it or not, the youth find a strong connection to the idea of being able to process and respond in their own time. In a world where everything is hyper connected, they find solace in being able to read a message without being put on the spot at all times. 

I’m not condoning or admonishing the behavior. Just giving my perspective on why it is the way it is."
krnzimb,thehelldoesthatmean,17,,1708636424,happy," I was wondering this too. Mostly because OP opened with ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" Which is how it was done when I was in high school. But with adult dating, for my generation at least,  you start out going on a few dates and then eventually ask them to be your girlfriend. You definitely wouldn't lead with that before even a first date."

You would feel strange about this? I would think it’s cute. If my husband was so happy about something we did or something I said, that he shared it with a community he was a part of.  As long as it didn’t have any identifying information, why.. would that.. be anything but positive? OP is sharing a happy moment.. on a forum about being happy."

kr0mm2g,simplisticwords,68,,1708278561,happy," Similar situation with my parents.

I dated a trans woman and my parents met her, and kept misgendering her. We corrected, and I snapped at them once while she had gone to the bathroom.

Next day I call to apologize for snapping and get ready to justify my snapping. Mom’s response (cavalier, no apologizing for misgendering, etc). Dad’s response was “I’m sorry for misgendering and you can tell her that - it was just your dating history has been guys and I slipped up trying to wrap my head around you dating a woman”. 

I teared up because like yours, mine is a man of few words."
kr0z4gw,xylofone,18,,1708282676,happy," As much as no one should need to be thanked for something like that. I hope you thanked him and gave some positive re-inforcement. For a lot of people they're not ill-intentioned, they've just been used to something else their entire lives, so it's new and it might legit make them slightly uncomfortbale. And maybe not intentionally, but part of them resists internalizing that update (they might see it as being ""corrected"", which is never fun), and then when it does come up it's just not at the top of their mind. Anyway, bravo to your dad."
kr3qvo2,Different-Horse-4578,3,,1708323761,happy, That’s beautiful!  I wish people understood how nonthreatening the whole trans thing really is.

krg1tjv,Stressmonkeyonastick,2,,1708521961,happy, Maybe ask your mum why she is having difficulty with it....might be something off the wall.  Give her a chance to say what she feels and sit with it for a minute without reacting.  Let her feel heard.  Only then can you say how it hurts you and your partner and negates your partner's identity. It might make it easier for her if she feels like you understand whatever is holding her back from adapting.  I hope all goes well and she treats your partner with respect.
kr1l6ju,Danimeh,2,,1708290484,happy," When my brother came out as non-binary (is that the right phrasing?) my mum was a bit resistant, and when he started doing T she was one of those ‘I support you but…’ kind of people. 

It sort of sucked a bit for my bro but I think both he and I knew mum loves him way too much to want to jeopardise their relationship over gender and she would come round after she had time to get used to the idea. 

Obviously the ideal would be she loves him way too much to subject him to her unhelpful comments during that period, but she’s human and sometimes humans get things wrong."

kr1cmie,ProofAdhesiveness652,11,,1708287446,happy," I think I felt so negative about all of it because my mom hasn’t really even seemed to try or would look annoyed any time I reminded/corrected her. Gentle or really hurt/annoyed by her reactions, nothing changed. My dad didn’t ever jump in and say anything to defend me or my mom, so just assumed he didn’t care either. One sentence confirmed I was wrong."

kqzw1bx,EmmaHawaii2,1,,1708268907,happy," I wish I could take full credit for that. But honestly I think I would give that credit more to my job experience for the last decade in 4 different positions with different companies, which forced me to learn how to present and put myself out there, in order to pitch a product or improve a team's ethics. I think this is what helped me when it came to my presentation at least. As far as essays go, it was pure dumb luck 😅 I studied as much as I could and then just took the risk. It ended up working out really well. So I am very proud of it and thankful for the lucky break 🙏"

kr5lcjl,PM_ME_A_PM_PLEASE_PM,1,,1708360004,happy, I think you should include information on non-fasting blood glucose levels. At least to my understanding it's different from the test I took at home as the test recommended I do it two hours after dinner.
kr7b1r9,thedancingkat,1,,1708380377,happy," That’s what we call a “post prandial” level. Kinda weird that’s what the sample is asking for as most non-insulin requiring BG samples need a fasting. Regardless, that’s a good post-pran level. But I do agree with the other person that if you think you’re having symptoms (increased thirst and urination, unintended weight loss) it wouldn’t hurt to go to your PCP because there is a blood test that they can see a level that measures about over a 3-month time span. (Pro tip: do not check a BG if it has been less than two hours since your last meal)

Happy you got the result you wanted! Hang in there and stay motivated, your future body will thank you ✨"
kr0el7q,havik09,2,,1708275805,happy," I JUST got confidence at 38.  You always look at yourself with the harshest of judgements. Being confident isn't in the body, it's in the mind"

Kinda on a whim for our 10 years together, it was a 5 minute ceremony with a justice of the peace in our backyard on a Wednesday afternoon.  I wore a dress from my closet that I barely even liked.  Your pic is beautifully casual.  You look so happy and content."

If you go on Amazon and search photo explosion box, that’s what I got! 

It’s really cool too! it’s like a box with multiple different layers so every time you open a lid more pictures come out. 

Basically you glue in photos of you and your partner on each level and you can decorate it, and I wrote on the top of very sweet saying that’s common between us :)

If you go look for it, it’ll probably be easier to understand what I’m saying but it’s so cute and it came out so nice!"

kqgczm7,astroworldfan1968,2,,1707951450,happy, Thanks. Today we did Trig Integration with trig identities 😭
kqcnimt,chickendie,6,,1707890914,happy," I'm not a social media guy. Don't have any other network's accounts. I play Animal Crossing on switch and on Reddit is the only place I can find players who is willing to gift you stuff, help you sell items without anything in return. "
kqckmts,_Spaceman_Spiff-,7,,1707889205,happy," After realizing that I was seeing an awful lot of negativity on my old account, I created a fresh account a few weeks ago. I only follow positive, funny, or thought-provoking threads. When something toxic or overly negative pops up, I’ve been diligent about hitting “show fewer posts like this.” It has been a delightful reminder that there are still helpful, hilarious, and brilliant people on Reddit!"
kqccsr2,Kyndrede_,3,,1707885085,happy," I totally agree. Some years back, I joined Reddit for the first time, and I saw some toxic comments. Assuming everyone was like that, I bailed and only came back a month or two ago. Maybe it’s the subs I’m in but most people are lovely, funny and very helpful. I regret having let a bunch of bad apples keep me away for so many years."
kqexlak,chunkyogini,2,,1707933249,happy, I’ve enjoyed Reddit since I joined. I’m always amazed at how insightful people are…. and hilarious! Bunch of amateur stand up comics on here. 😃
kqfsxpa,Ancient_Stretch_803,2,,1707944304,happy, Reddit is a Very Positive site. They enforce it. I am comfortable with that. Another site allowed many disrespectful people and glad i left that it
kqg2nht,mtntrail,2,,1707947690,happy," For me the key to an overall enjoyable experience is to make a very tightly curated “home” feed of the subs I like  and stay completely away from politics, “news” or anything else that is divisive and negative. It takes some time to put it together and I run across new ones as time goes on."
kqcewu5,AngelaMotorman,1,,1707886131,happy," I've wasted a lot of time here over the past 15 years, and I totally agree. How much toxicity you run into is mostly a matter of which subreddits you subscribe to. (I recommend r/PointyTailedKittens, in particular.)

Adding, just today Columbia Journalism Review posted a story titled
[""The most civilized place to look at news online? It might be Reddit"",](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-real-time-news-twitter-substitute.php) which reflects the reality that even the news and politics subreddits are far less toxic than they're often portrayed."
kqgb7ca,whoisgringo1979999,1,,1707950781,happy, I dropped facebook and gravitated to reddit. It was very loud over there. Much quieter over here. To boot the specific subreddits are to die for.
kqcp1jg,,1,,1707891877,happy," I can't wait to play animal crossing dude! I'm saving up for a switch. 


Thanks for the info too. Maybe I can visit your and other people's islands someday 😸"
kqd49rp,Ok-Situation-5522,1,,1707903154,happy, Same on all platforms.
kqcdl83,,2,,1707885468,happy," Glad you came back and you're enjoying it here too 😁
Still so many more communities/subs to venture into though.

kqhs5j5,,1,,1707972926,happy," This is great news to me thanks!
I love cats and would also love a place to talk, be informed, calmly disagree, and hear many different opinions in an understanding fashion. Can't wait to check it out :D"
kqcrwpc,chickendie,2,,1707893786,happy," Haha my island is pretty mediocre. But you should definitely check out r/acturnips, that's where people are willing to invite you to their island and sell turnips at a crazy price (we get a random price everyday).  And r/animalcrossingdesign for inspiration. Also r/dodocodes to get visiting invitations "

kq9fw7d,8_CyberLover_7,2,,1707846365,happy," Cuddly cats are the best! I love the ones that are more rambunctious and who don’t like cuddling, but when a cat is cuddly it feels special.

This reminds me of my cat. She was also a stray! She chose you, so cute. It’s also so cute that she escaped but came back 😭. That is the worst nightmare of every cat owner, but of course she came back. 

Thanks for posting and yay for cats"

I would twist and gently pull off Dead flower heads, the manager told me this was to help them grow back next yr.  And the flowers always came back"
kq6t2zd,ksljdlfjoj,2,,1707797754,happy," They need a lot of sun! Mine is on an east facing window sill. I water it in the sink every 7 days or so. Roots should dry out before watering again. I probably “feed” it with plant food like 4 times per year. Ive only owned like 4 orchids but 2 of them have reflowered, one of them twice."

kq3wa1o,kimwim43,10,,1707759038,happy," Wow.

Were you lucky in compatible outlooks on life? want for/no children? religion? incomes? job career intensity? treating each other with respect? the important things? Amount of risk? Travel urges? This is wild. 

My parents met in May, married in September. Married 50 years, then she passed. 

I wish you 50+ happy years together!"
kq40lfq,JoseLunaArts,5,,1707760510,happy," Remember a relationship is not about compatibility.  It is about the moments and interactions you BUILD.

Make the relationship a space to improve mental health of both.

Make it a space to grow and achieve dreams.

It has to go both sides.

Grudges kill love, do not let it be between you.  drama is for teenagers, adult people fix problems talking.

Remind each other that you love each other every day as if it was the first day."
krp66d0,ProlificMystic33,2,,1708651751,happy," I had the same type of experience when I met my husband.  We had some intense bizarre soul recognition.  We were both mind blown because we both knew without a doubt we found our person and that is a crazy feeling to just KNOW something so deeply without a doubt.  We’ve been married 7 years now and it’s still like the honey moon.  It feels like only 2 years have gone by, it’s been so awesome and amazing time has just flown!  We always say we won the love lottery!  When things happen so quick, a lot of people will most likely doubt you and the connection you say you have and that’s because most people never experience this type of love.  With time people will stop doubting you.  We had so many people trying to tell us to slow down but the funny thing is we have the strongest happiest relationship of everyone we know.  So it was like, they had no clue what they were talking about because people can’t know what they haven’t experienced.  I wish you both a long, happy healthy life together!  It always makes me happy when I hear of others that win the love lottery!"
kq416pv,Ok_Mountain_9984,6,,1707760712,happy,"  we are lucky on many levels, we are both not religious but from orthodox families we have similar opinions on that and also about children, other things we can talk about it, we both think that love comes first and everything else can be solved/ compromised with respect to each others' feelings/needs. when we first met I had an office job, he was all about enjoying life and traveling, I loved it and left my job, I didn't have any money so he encouraged me and supported me totally until I learned how to find work online to help him. we both think the other person is more important than work/money. I do have big dreams about my career I shared with him and we agreed to do our best to help each other achieve those things. 

thank you so much for your lovely wish, we also married in Sep so hope we are as strong as your parents!"
kq41c6i,Ok_Mountain_9984,2,,1707760764,happy, totally agree with you!

I hope you’ll be able to meet with your friend. Might give you a little bright spot in the middle of a difficult time. And no, that’s not sad and pathetic at all! It’s a lovely thing that made you happy, and that is all that’s important"
kpvq5pg,Mundane-Historian322,10,,1707625154,happy," You aren’t sad and pathetic whatsoever. The winter time is hard and the dark days can make getting out of bed a struggle. I have been struggling too and I just got a therapy light? Haven’t ever looked into one of those? They have them available pretty cheap on Amazon and it really does help.

I’m so happy for you and glad that this brought you joy. I’m glad things are turning up for you!"
kpvztwf,noduta,10,,1707630093,happy, I also struggled with major depression and haven't go out at all and one day my friends suddenly called me even after I cancelled our supposed meet up and said they're already outside my house.

kpwk65w,zynfulcreations,5,,1707641448,happy," Two things:
Give yourself the grace that you give to others.
Growth happens outside your comfort zone.

kpxkny4,htid1984,4,,1707661568,happy, It's not sad or pathetic mate. I sometimes feel like life is small wins and big downs so celebrate your small wins because they are in fact huge and they are what get you through. Be happy and do follow up with your mate because you obviously mean a lot to him still and I bet he felt nervous as hell reconnecting just in case you rejected him. Depression will make you doubt it but if you meant nothing to him he wouldn't have picked up the phone.
kpxtdqn,albjrbmcb,4,,1707664760,happy," I’m glad you reconnected with an old friend.  I too got a random text one day from one of my high school friends.  To verify it was really her, I made her tell me what nickname we had for her car!  It was her!  We have had several lunch dates and brought our husbands for dinner and drinks together.  We’re not as close as we were back in high school but it has been nice to hang out with her occasionally because the feeling of friendship has never faded."

kpvfhl0,coldWasTheGnd,5,,1707620260,happy," Not my house; just keys so that I can come any time I want; she complained that she's gone too often to take care of it and basically begged me to stay as often as I can.

I work remotely so I can travel wherever, whenever; the only difference here is that I have friends who are willing to host me for a very extended length of time."
kpv3wmw,Zagenti,2,,1707615236,happy," video chat. Free. Anywhere in the world. When my best friend moved away, we watched movies together on zoom lol"

kpvpqpf,HomebodyBoebody,1,,1707624958,happy, Good job. My partner changed careers to PT in his 30's from a poorly paid biomedical field. It was a very long road but worth it. He also had a single mom and mostly surrounded by wealthier younger people

kpt97ow,Exercise-Scientist,2,,1707589174,happy," There's an element of that to it sometimes for sure. Right now I work as a technician in a hospital based outpatient place, so most of the people we see are older folks that just had a joint replacement or someone that broke their arm playing a sport or something like that. I think my exposure to this side of PT definitely made me like it more."
kpvailv,,4,,1707618075,happy," This is probably not at all what you wanna hear and this isn’t to invalidate you at all but, it’s good to think that you’ve been lucky to experience such a friendship— it’s hard to find deep friendships that really affect you these days"

kpwmq7y,No_Patience8886,2,,1707642982,happy," I'm really happy for you! I'm currently going through the same thing, except going no contact because they've been extremely manipulative.

kpy43qs,DangerMouseD33,2,,1707668408,happy," This resonated with me I had some really great friendships break up and fantastic fashion. They were harder than my marriage ending. I know it’s hard to move beyond, proud and happy for you."

ksg39ec,oscuroluna,1,,1709073184,happy," Hey I know that all too well. Friendship breakups can be painful especially when you have years shared together. 

Its wonderful to get to a place of forgiveness and wishing people happiness and even better that you're looking forward to making new friends."
kpw6ofh,,3,,1707633669,happy," I didn't include the stuff she did that made me end our friendship as I don't want anyone to recognize me. In the end I did forgive her though if she does any more shit it's over forever. 

Thanks for the support, and it takes time but it gets better, it hurts more to hate them and hold a grudge x"

They both live/d at least 6 hours from me. I wish I could have provided more care, but I'm still caring for two children myself. It's wonderful they have you ❤️"
kpo9k0p,medic00,86,,1707505017,happy, Ofcourse not. The most important thing is that you are happy. You can be proud of yourself that you discovered how to be happy for yourself. Some people never get that in life. Dont let social media or anything else dictate how you should live your life.
kpoezyw,CertainDig184,48,,1707506911,happy, Thank you all. I think I just needed a little reassuring today. :)
kpo9gjv,Elcodfish,21,,1707504984,happy," If you are happy, who cares!  I am sure your area has a gardening club if you wanted to expand your circle.  I am 42 and we moved 1000+ miles over 10 years ago and we made friends by volunteering in dog rescue and going to trivia nights, if you were looking for casual friends it's not a bad start."
kpof700,_HOBI_,16,,1707506980,happy," This is something I often think about. I think a lot of it stems from the social narrative that we need to be living our best lives, living every moment to the fullest, traveling, experiencing everything all the time. I’ll be 50 this year and most of my time is spent at home in bliss in my comfortable and safe environment. I genuinely feel happy, but nonetheless, I frequently experience guilt that I’m not doing or accomplishing more, again, stemming from those social pressures that convey we don’t have value if we’re not “doing” or “producing.”

Thankfully, I have an incredibly supportive partner. I was a stay at home mom for over 20 years while my husband served in the military and was often gone. I have amazing kids and great relationships with both, breaking generations of abusive cycles. I also came from an extremely trauma-filled childhood and then right into motherhood, so there was never really time for me. My husband said I should consider myself retired and let him take care of me so I can finally live my life for me. Problem is I don’t even know what I wanna do*, but I’m happy just existing for the moment.

*I have a degree in sociology and I’ve held part-time jobs from time-to-time in either nonprofits or school systems with children. I have also frequently volunteered, but I don’t want to go back to those areas of work because they are exploitative and pay so very little so I’m kind of in limbo right now while enjoying the happiness and peace that comes from staying away from other people. 

Besides, these are dystopian times and who knows how much longer will all be living life the way we are now, so I’m trying to enjoy it while I can."
kpong7o,peanut_butting,12,,1707509852,happy, Can we be friends? Almost same story minus 20 years. I'm semi happy lol
kpoy08u,rainbwbrightisntpunk,8,,1707513530,happy," I'm just a few years younger than you and people are constantly trying to get me out to be more ""social "" thanks, No. If I want to ok. I have everything I want and need at home and pay a damn lot of money for this space so I'm going to enjoy it! Also I've come to realize a lot of people don't have any hobbies so they don't have anything to enjoy doing at home so they're looking for outside stimulation."
kpojdcu,GloriousSteinem,7,,1707508427,happy, I used to like a good party and my friends still do but now I’m content by doing the stuff you do. It’s hard to explain to friends who think I’m vegetating but I’ve never been so creative. I think it’s fine

kpora5f,speckledgem,5,,1707511177,happy," Yes. I will caveat that I have a couple very good friends and I **love** their company, but during lockdown my husband and I (and the dog) absolutely loved it. I was able to work from home and he was on a weird shift-pattern that meant he only had to do half his shifts as they were single manning. It took us a **long** time after lockdown to get back to normal, and we still haven’t really got back to our pre-lockdown social life. 

If you’re happy, not lonely and aren’t just co-dependent I’d ignore the social butterflies; half of its fake anyway."

We move often for work & normally I volunteer with several organizations or take classes to get to know the area & feel like part of a community. Not this move. I've become a very happy homebody. Very different than my norm & unsure exactly why. My theory is it's a blend of reaction to the pandemic years as well as getting older. Whatever the reasons. I'm enjoying this phase. 

You're happy. You're content. Do you feel you're missing out? You don't sound like it. Cheers. 🥂"

However, I have been known to go out and do things by myself (restaurant, food, museum, etc).

kpriowg,frejas-rain,2,,1707559075,happy," Same here! Some people give me pushback, tell me I should ""get out more."" Ha, it's not their life, it's mine. This is what makes me truly happy, and it's none of their beeswax anyway. 🐝  Be true to yourself!"
kpt36dm,GR33N4L1F3,2,,1707586977,happy, Whatever makes you happy. That sounds heavenly to me!
kptpm9t,Feeling_Excitement90,2,,1707595208,happy," Don’t listen to social media!! Do whatever makes you happy, and it sounds like you are incredibly happy! (Your life sounds ideal tbh to me a 39 year old mom to two neurodivergent kids under 7)"
kpu156a,fakemessiah,2,,1707599580,happy," I'm 40 and I'm perfectly content riding out life solo. I have my son, brother and niece, and my father for awhile. I prefer books to people."
kpu9kbf,HeyKrech,2,,1707602833,happy," I live about twenty minutes from two best friends and I am only able to see each in person about three or four times a year. I love staying home. I have a hard time juggling cleaning and fixing things during weekdays that are busy with work and other tasks, so having time at home is a treasure. 

And I'm 51 1/2. I feel like my parents had more social time at my age because their parents were younger and needed less help from their kids while my parents also had less expectations for themselves towards their teenagers. (my grandparents were about 20 when my parents were born, my parents were about 30 when my husband and I were born). Society shares expectations that don't fit for so many of us, including how many friends we need to feel happy. 

We have two teens - one almost 20 and one almost 16, and two dogs. I've got plenty of interactions with my immediate family, and adding in the people I work with so often more than I'd like. 

Enjoy your time at home."
kpoubh7,Specialist-Strain502,1,,1707512235,happy, I do think you may be setting yourself up for struggle and isolation if your husband dies. Might be worth considering how you can build yourself a more sustainable social network over the course of the next few years. :)

kppbb1d,SapientSlut,1,,1707518316,happy," I would just make sure you have some friends who you can count on if your husband gets sick or passes first - you don’t need tons of friends, but loneliness can be killer 💜"

kpy8o45,hivernageprofond,1,,1707669921,happy," Thank you SO MUCH for this post! I feel myself wondering the same... but not wondering so much as knowing. I was taught I needed to be a social butterfly for narcissistic reasons (mom), and that required me putting myself out there when i was not comfortabledoing so. I had a few close friends growing up, but having a slew of issues, including childhood trauma and undiagnosed adhd (diagnosed at 50), attracted the wrong for me kind of friends. Add to that the severe illness, my mother's passing, my husband losing two jobs in less than a year both before christmas and losing family members to certain ideologies has made me love being a homebody.  It also has made me reflect greatly on my mothers negative influence over my development. We made good in the end, so no worries there, but it was a brief 6 months of her finally saying things every mom should tell her child. Since then, I've realized I did so much that wasn't me just to please her. But my spirit is more ""tenacious challenger of the norms"" or as she would have called me ""brat""....and and my tenaciousness has found new freedom

I even decided I had to let my ""best friend"" go... which has been incredibly difficult as we have almost zero network here. 

But YES! I am finally feeling happy, and I am getting more resilient and stronger. I know a lot of my issues come from codependency and bonding issues, and I'm working on those. I do want to sometimes get out there and am looking into small groups (like art therapy for now). My husband can only listen to me so much, and the 17 and 11 yo old are about the same with that, lol. And of course, I talk to my cats!

I really enjoy being at home now more because where I live things are, well if I'd say ""tense"" that'd be a nice word for it, but insane and severe anxiety inducing would be more accurate :-)"
kq8fe6x,,1,,1707833304,happy, with the dogs you get to go to dog parks etc. You'll meet people there. You're not kidding about the hard to make friends at our age part ...
kpprjms,Cynical-Wanderer,20,,1707524699,happy," This is correct.  I like being at home more than anyplace else.  I enjoy an occasional trip, but there’s nothing like being at home.  My family.  My hobbies.  My books.  This is where I make my life and where life happens to me.  

Social media is a pox on life.  It doesn’t know you.  Do “you” to the best of your ability and be happy."
kpojvxh,GloriousSteinem,10,,1707508606,happy," There is that pressure to be extraordinary, to have amazing hobbies and side hustles, to run that marathon, travel to that country, dance all weekend. They’re all good things, but in the past no one cared too much if they were laid back and enjoyed the act of living."
kpycrts,hivernageprofond,2,,1707671257,happy," You sound so much like me, but I was a military brat, twice over (dad and a step dad). It's amazing that you were able to maintain good relationships with your children. I think the moving around and my father being on deployment so much affected us all differently. 

My mom was a narcissist, and there's a lot of trauma there, as well as for her in her youth. I decided I wanted to be a sahm because I knew I wouldn't be able to be the mom I wanted to be and work. My husband supports this fully. I did work until 35 when I had my first child ( I had my 2nd at 41). I homeschooled them both for a while due to the seriously bad educational system in our state (which is taking an even more serious nose dive as of late) but one of my kids is a social butterfly so she's in an Arts high school, the 11 yo stays at home and prefers it that way. We are happy to indulge her and her more nerdy techy Feynman like ways...which she gets from my husband, lol.

My husband and both my kids are asd. He was just diagnosed at 53, and we all have adhd. I just got diagnosed with adhd 3 years ago at 50! I'd say I definitely made the right choices for myself and my kids, and we both feel this way. Our kids are bright, intelligent...and can hold conversations with most people no matter the age of that person. We work continuously on breaking the cycle of trauma that was foisted on us both in our youth and it's caused us to have to cut a lot of family out who want to continue to behave badly and bury things that should never have been buried. 

But we are happier than we would have been had we kept these people in our lives. And we are learning to continuously adjust and accept change in this ""dystopian"" world we are currently living in in the armpit of the south. As a former military brat who tried hard to keep in touch with her friends (even the other military brats), I totally get how hard it is to make new friends at this age. 

I realized all my friends were attracted to me and me them through our mutual messed up childhoods.. .and probably adhd and autism, which trauma can appear as. So yeah... I'll stick with my husband because we're a team, and we'll work through things and support each other, but I never got that from any friend outside my marriage.  I feel like it's worth keeping company with others because I find different people interesting (in other words I LOVED moving, lol) but I no longer feel I HAVE to have friends other than my husband because I'm finally becoming happy with myself....as I get to know her."
kpoo24p,CertainDig184,25,,1707510062,happy, Absolutely but we can only hang out twice a year!!! ☺️
kpoypcz,CertainDig184,5,,1707513776,happy, Right? I pay more and more every day. Can barely afford to leave the house.
kpooqoa,CertainDig184,11,,1707510297,happy, Yes!!! My kids are constantly telling me that studies show people with big social circles live longer. TBH I’d be ok losing a year or two vs a bunch of fake friends.
kpydwv4,hivernageprofond,2,,1707671626,happy, And her new book too!
kporrco,CertainDig184,3,,1707511342,happy, You’re totally correct…it’s so phony out in the “real world”
kpr29hq,Chutneykayak,1,,1707546971,happy, Wisdom right here!
kpoz61k,CertainDig184,2,,1707513940,happy, I’m weak and I guess I need validation. Haha I’ve always been shy and on the quiet side. Always felt a bit odd so I needed to find out it’s not just me who feels this way.
kq6eaxg,_HOBI_,2,,1707791455,happy," Oh my gosh, the trauma friendships, yes! I had many, unfortunately. 

My husband was in the Air Force and we were very fortunate that he only deployed once and we only moved three times because of the nature of his career. He was gone a lot for training, but it was usually only six weeks to three months at a time so it was far less separation than a lot of military.

My mother was/is also a narcissist. She was a primary abuser. I never really thought about motherhood growing up or had aspirations of becoming a mom, but when I became one, I sort of instinctively knew to give my children what Little Me deserved and what my mother couldn’t. I’m very fortunate in that regard because so often these behaviors are cyclical and I didn’t have a single good example from any woman in my family of what a healthy marriage and good mother looked like. I honestly think being in the military and never living near my family really allowed me to become the mother I needed to be, and away from any potential drama with her. 

Another similarity: I’m was just diagnosed with ADHD last month.  😆 what’s funny, until I got on TikTok, I had never considered that I might have ADHD because symptoms 
(outside of hyperactivity & inattentiveness) and spreading awareness were never made available to GenX and earlier; and even then it was only boys. All my life I simply thought I was weird and quirky and didn’t fit in because I was too different. When I started seeing women my age listing symptoms of ADHD I realized they were also describing me. after my assessment last month my therapist said my ADHD was “through the roof.” 😆I know labels don’t really matter, but understanding that there’s a reason I am the way I am has given me tremendous relief."

kps4dau,Fatty-Apples,3,,1707573145,happy, No friends is better than bad friends. Some people never learn this lesson.
kpydb2x,hivernageprofond,1,,1707671434,happy," Yes! Those articles drive me nuts, and I was majoring in psychology, so I read a lot of that kind of stuff. I think my issue is that I like to be creative...it's my jam , but after having kids and now learning I have adhd it's made me realize friends are nice to have every once in a while but my brain NEEDS less distraction!"
kpr25t2,Chutneykayak,1,,1707546905,happy, And shallow or superfluous.
kpngf69,Small-Honeydew-5970,10,,1707495013,happy, Even if you can’t wait for the holiday proposal put some thought into it and make it special for her instead of just popping it because you are so excited you can’t wait. Good luck!

kpo0ss8,DeannaC-FL,2,,1707502014,happy," Do you have another favorite place close to your home? 

If yes & it's outdoors you could put together a romantic picnic spread and do it there...or if it's a restaurant or some sort of public establishment (museum, or wherever) you could enlist the help of the staff to get a cool setup in place this weekend. If you have a dog, you could have them ""help"" by hiding (tying) the ring inside their collar and putting a note to your girlfriend on the outside once you get to the park or special place you like to take your dog.

Just some ideas if you really can't wait...good luck & congrats!"

 “We were just two days away from the end of our time on Fergusson Island in Papua New Guinea when one of our remote cameras recorded the bird walking around and fanning its tail.” - Jordan Boermsa, co led the expedition."

kp8ul7s,64CarClan,5,,1707258533,happy," Congratulations to you, this is wonderful to hear.   What I find most enjoyable for you is that you are able to recognize your happiness today, despite the challenges you have been facing.  This is critically important.   

If I may offer some suggestions:  Tomorrow, please use these beautiful memories as a way to recreate your positive emotions from today.  Then do the same tomorrow night and each day moving forward.   If you are inclined, blend these gratitudes into your talking or praying with God.

Identify a small, resonable number of aspects of your life that you are grateful for each morning before you get out of bed and in evening before falling asleep.  Soon this becomes your new normal and your blessings are everywhere.

Life will begin to be so much brighter and the best part is that the world around you ( the world without) will not change, but indeed you significantly changed the world you live in (the world within)

Best of luck.  If you feel comfortable, please send updates.  I'll save you post to watch your many successes. ❤️❤️🙏🙏💜

kp939q9,MnrRooikat,2,,1707261652,happy, The feeling you're describing is how I felt when I took 5-htp supplements for the first time. Like at some point in my day I looked up and smiled and felt like everything was going to be ok and that there's hope for the future for the first time in months. Turns out low serotonin levels leads to depression and anxiety. Who knew (/s).
kp9sh3f,JG_in_TX,2,,1707271267,happy," I read a pretty good book called, ""Hardwiring Happiness,"" where it talks about how our minds are naturally wired to focus on negative, worrisome things.  It's built into the primal part of our brains and designed to keep us alive.  Back when humans could be tiger or bear food, it was better to worry about little things like rustling in the grass versus ignore it and be eaten.

Today that mechanism is still there, and for some always searching for something to latch onto.  Life events can trigger it more strongly, like trauma, and certain mental health issues too like depression or anxiety.

Basically doing what you did...enjoying the sunset and letting that moment stay on your mind...is one of the ways to get your brain away from its natural negativity bias.  If you do that a few times a day with things that bring you joy, after a while your mind seeks those things out.  Key is to pause of what makes you happy and not just go on to something else.

It's very cool you had a happy day and I hope you have more beautiful sunsets and other joyful things to admire!"
kp9bl71,8_CyberLover_7,1,,1707264798,happy," Yay! Thats something to celebrate. The thing about being happy and peaceful is it needs no reason to be, it can just exist as is. 

I remember having moments like that when i was struggling with depression. They give such hope, and serve as a reminder that there will be better days and life wasn’t as hopeless and dire as I imagined during the worst bits.

Wishing you the best of luck & joy in your future!!! ❤️🙏. Thank you for spreading joy into my life with this post :)"

kpaok76,64CarClan,2,,1707286026,happy," Yes it absolutely does.  Not sure if you've talked with your PCP, but connecting with a Psychiatrist would be a very beneficial experience for you.  Over the past year I've learned that psychiatrist's are focused on how to help stabilize our mental processes ( our brain) via medications.   They are absolute experts in this field and know that sometimes it is a bit of art (trial and error) vs science to find the proper med(s).  
My son is about to graduate MedSchool and blessedly has taught me the same.  Psychiatrists are not Therapists, and seeking a Therapist along with Psychiatrist is the ultimate combination.

Best of luck to you in your future, make it as bright as a Beacon to the sea"
kpapkib,MnrRooikat,1,,1707286653,happy," Thanks for the advice, and I'm already a step ahead of you haha. Luckily it seems like it's enough to rebalance my levels without going onto SSRIs. 
I totally agree with you though. My psychs have done a great job caring about getting me to a better more stable place. The stigma against going in to take care of your mental health is going away, but it's still a hurdle for a lot of people. Therapy is enough for most people who don't have a chemical imbalance."
kpasf2s,64CarClan,2,,1707288487,happy," Yeahhhh, this makes me so happy as well.  Agree  that SSRI  is not the only answer, there are many and we should rely on those of us who specialize in the subject.
Thankfully the stigma is reducing, yet unfortunate it's still there. The more of us that talk openly about this the better. We will continue to help others.
 haha haha and this is coming from an older dude who fully believed, Pre Covid Pandemic, that the shut up and suck it up approach was the only and proper approach for us males.   But was I WRONG.
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Thankfully some MDs help me realize this 🙏🙏"
kp8rawu,Anilxe,13,,1707257395,happy," As someone with a lot of self hate because of my past and my childhood, I started using the people around me as a mirror because I decided my own perception of me is not to be trusted. 

Since then, I’ve realized what an amazing person I am, even when I’m sad and not doing well. I have people that love me for my warmth and my fire, my eagerness to help others in ways I don’t expect back, because it just feels right. And it’s made me love those people so much more, because what beautiful people they must be to be able to convince me of my own beauty!

Listen to your friend. 💙"
kpc1ulq,bkj512,2,,1707316376,happy," Whoever that is, yeah. Hold on to them. It's sad, I might have gotten told this a few times even but I don't even remember as much probably left."

That said, all my belongings are still piled up in their boxes or blocking my way around my room!  It has taken me 4 months to make a dent in unpacking, and there are still so many boxes!

saying this based on my own experience. it is natural to get discouraged when it doesn't stay completely neat. living in it will mess it up, and that's ok! everything changes, nothing is permanent - but that counts for depression and mess as well as feeling grounded in tidy surroundings. life can be messy... but it can also be neat and tidy. you are resilient and can handle it! best wishes."

You are making a good decision.   


I was a pothead, and I mean like mega mega pothead from the time I was 16-23, like 24/7 stoned. I feel like, while I had fun those years, I also wasted some peak years because honestly, while pot is fun, it just kind of numbs life. Like being wrapped in a big blanket all the time.  


I would skip social events to smoke, missed concerts, disappointed family just to be home and stay stoned.   


Fast forward like, 12 years later now and while *I can still enjoy puff now and then*, I don't at all enjoy day smoking or public smoking. I don't miss the paranoia, the fuzzy feeling, nor the desperation when you run out and the plug isn't answering his phone. I don't miss eating the entire content of my kitchen and forgetting I did that. I know where you live has dispensaries so that's good but yeah, in my day we were hiding in parking lots or texting strangers. You can get away with that when you're 17-18, like then it's kinda lowkey badass, but the older you get, the sadder it is.  Can you imagine a middle aged woman fiending for a joint? Yeah, I wouldn't want to be her either!"
kp5mbu2,anonymike,14,,1707210957,happy," Congratulations. Give it a month or more and examine your mental clarity. The difference can be quite striking. You may have some rough patches in the first couple of weeks, but a gentle reminder that you’re experiencing withdrawal symptoms can make it easier to cope. Like if you suddenly find yourself overly emotional or even angry for seemingly no reason. It’s the withdrawal. It passes."

kp7ctq7,Carnanian,4,,1707240542,happy," This is awesome! I also am reimagining my relationship with weed. After 2 years of taking gummies damn near every night, I'm taking a tolerance break and I will be doing my best to.use it less, maybe 3x a week instead.

I'm also trying to quit, but to help with sleep issues I've been abstaining except for 1-2 hits about an hour before bed. The burnout helps me fall asleep but without saturating my receptors with THC all day and night, I find the nightmares have continued. I remember every second of them too, it's actual hell.

kpm7hn3,CompetitiveCare1563,1,,1707473411,happy," Congrats! Im in the same boat. Smoke all day everyday for years and its basically just a bad habit at this point.

Hope it all pans put like you want! "
kp5whqc,Cwreck92,4,,1707218544,happy," Not to scare you OP, but my experience with dreaming after quitting weed was far from enjoyable. I had the most insane nightmares and just all around weird/freaky dreams. It lasted a good month before they finally went away. 

Now I just have incredibly vivid dreams that have entire plots, character arcs, etc.

Regardless, congratulations on quitting. I quit just over a year ago after smoking pretty much every day and night for over a decade. Welcome to your “new high”, being sober from weed."

kp37gos,Migraine_Megan,7,,1707170520,happy," Hm let me clarify. I am now 40. Symptoms began around age 36-37. Supraventricular tachycardia causes the heart to beat too fast and I inherited it. It is so unusual for someone my age to develop it, that they thought my symptoms were just asthma. Years went by and I got worse and worse. For nearly all of 2023 I couldn't exercise at all, aka complete exercise intolerance. It was bad enough I should've gone to the ER but I didn't know that until later. I had a Dr House situation, an exceptional doctor took my case, identified the issue as a heart problem and testing began. The biggest clue was my dad's heart attack when he was 38, followed by sudden cardiac death. He didn't have high blood pressure or cholesterol, same as me. They couldn't just medicate first. My CT showed a healthy, plaque free heart. It is ""just"" an electrical issue. I took meds, felt better and began rebuilding atrophied muscles. It has been extremely difficult to push past the fatigue but I'm determined. And it's Ms Guy to you 😂"

I was leaving for uni so I was training my now wife to take my position and since I was already a trainer, I had my professional head on. My supervisor who was a mate of both of us started sending joke texts from each of our phones to one another which would always spark some flirting and joking and it just snowballed. Started working together whenever we could and by the time I left, we were seeing each other outside of work regularly. Its crazy to think that such a silly input from a friend is the reason we are married and have a son together and that it happened when our lives only overlapped for such a short amount of time"

You can have both of you make a few concessions."

kow36yz,HarbaughCheated,1,,1707062206,happy," I do not think you know what you’re talking about, no offense. You literally wear your achievements on your uniform in the military…

your envy and fixation is the lack of tact here, you are missing the point of the sub to try to make someone feel bad about being successful. this is weirdo behavior"
kouc52g,Thekijael,124,,1707024820,happy," That’s what I’m fishing for, 400k is unrealistically high in today’’s market especially if you’re under 30."
koum9tg,HarbaughCheated,6,,1707031179,happy, I work at a FAANG. Nothing I said was a lie
kow1it2,xandrachantal,3,,1707061587,happy, I didn't want to be the one to say it but yeah I'm not buying it either
koumiye,Thekijael,5,,1707031355,happy, I did. Levels had software engineer 1 at my company listed at 175k. Totally inaccurate.
kouywfu,Potato_Tg,30,,1707040252,happy," Yk it was more believable before this message. 

Maybe you’re this person idk But if you are.. it’s like you MAXXED out on luck or something."
kov9fzn,jesusmohammed,6,,1707047962,happy," I see. I thought you had graduated from Harvard or MIT, and sold your first startup at the age of 20 then won Forbes 30 under 30 or something. That’s an incredible amount of luck similar to winning a million-dollar lottery, can't say I'm not envious, but congratulations nonetheless."
kowjhzu,Wild_Nectarine666,4,,1707068058,happy," Idk why people are downvoting you. If you’re telling the truth, this is incredible! And if you’re lying, the amount of effort to come
up with a story with details for a random post online that gets you no money would be bizarre.

So I’ll choose to believe you and say well done, and keep going! My bf is in the Air Force, and it’s absolutely possible to make good choices and work hard and accomplish all of this by 30. It’s no easy feat, which is why it’s worthy of acknowledgement for sure. Good job 👍"
kows2ky,sorrysorrymybad,1,,1707071036,happy," Check out Levels.fyi and come back with what you learn.

It's totally doable."
kountvy,HarbaughCheated,14,,1707032266,happy, You haven’t worked FAANG. My managers and team leads pulling in $1 mil tc with stock growth lol
kouf3a2,aster__,7,,1707026540,happy, I make >400k and I’m 26 as a software engineer. I know many people like me as well. In this field it’s not as rare as you think
koumsfq,ipickscabs,1,,1707031539,happy," Yes, you’ve done it. Finally!"
koumsv3,HarbaughCheated,5,,1707031548,happy," Also we have refreshers at my company. Which brings comp up a lot. And stock perf has done great. My initial hire grant is up 41%. 

Levels is pretty accurate for FAANG, I’ve worked at two of them and used them for negotiation between offers to know what type of comp to expect last time I hopped jobs (2021)"
kow3jg9,HarbaughCheated,2,,1707062336,happy," Wouldn’t say it’s luck, it wasn’t easy. That term is just used to disparage someone’s accomplishments"
kow3t50,HarbaughCheated,2,,1707062435,happy," Graduated from The Ohio State University. You don’t need to go to MIT or Harvard to break into FAANG, and FAANG is a great way to build wealth and break into top tech"
koxdj5s,chicagodude84,1,,1707078623,happy," That's not what I said. I said OP is full of shit. Just because 400k per year jobs exist doesn't mean OP has one. Especially considering the info they've provided. 

Likely OP is talking about their total compensation, which includes stocks and long term bonuses. Which is NOT salary."
kovfzvf,dreaminphp,5,,1707052033,happy," OP don’t bother with these people. I’m 28, own 2 homes, married and made a little over 500k last year in software dev. People don’t want to believe it because they’re jealous of your success"
kovnk8p,mhoner,71,,1707055849,happy, Getting a 401k does not mean your pay is 401k.
kouf6p2,Thekijael,37,,1707026598,happy," 400k?? Nah dude. Doesn’t exist. What’s your title?

I’m in the same field. I’m literally a software engineer and I don’t know anyone who makes that much."

koyhez1,jesusmohammed,1,,1707093708,happy," Do you mind telling more about the details, for example, how did you get the interview? Did you apply? How many Leetcodes do you practice every day? How did you practice for the interview itself? Are you worried about the rising layoffs?"
koxfpf2,sorrysorrymybad,0,,1707079402,happy," I'm confused. He never specified that he's getting $400k in salary. He said he's getting paid $400k a year, i.e., in total comp. That includes stocks that vest. Given that he works in Meta, a public listed company, vested stock can be sold for cash and is essentially treated as cash compensation. Same story with bonuses. That's exactly how it's calculated in the SF tech scene.

The detail he provided (E5 at Meta) tracks with having a total comp of $400k. What makes you think he's lying?"
koufrq8,aster__,10,,1707026955,happy," Senior eng at a pretty big unicorn. Often pays near or at the top of levels.fyi. https://www.levels.fyi/leaderboard/Software-Engineer/Senior-Engineer/country/United-States/

Edit: added link"
koun4px,HarbaughCheated,15,,1707031777,happy," Dude, no offense but you genuinely do not know what you’re talking about. 

What do you have questions about? I’m an e5 at meta, check the stock performance. Android eng on a product team, and prior to that I was a backend eng at Amazon working on prime video. Mostly work with Kotlin / Java with my stack. Happy to answer any questions you have but wild you think I’m lying just because you don’t know anyone in a faang"
koxoq6f,chicagodude84,2,,1707082645,happy," Because I have worked in the business for a long time and I can count on one hand the number of developers  I know who make 400k a year. And I've worked almost entirely with F50 clients. I sincerely doubt he makes 400k total package, tbh. 

But I also don't care enough to continue this. Because it doesn't matter at all."
koufwom,Thekijael,39,,1707027038,happy," So how in the world do you land a role that pays that much at 26?? You have max a few years of experience. This doesn’t add up,"
kouoqel,HarbaughCheated,16,,1707032900,happy," E5 at meta here, but stock growth pushed me over $400k as a recent promo"
kouhh52,Thekijael,4,,1707028016,happy, Nice google but those numbers are entirely unrealistic. These salaries do not exist.
kounbj6,Thekijael,-14,,1707031910,happy," Yes by naming big companies you’re totally believable. 

I stand by my official opinion as a software engineer myself… NOBODY MAKES THIS MUCH BEFORE 30 you’re so clearly lying"
koyor2j,sorrysorrymybad,1,,1707096656,happy," So based on your own anecdotal evidence you insist that he must be wrong, even though independent compensation websites validate what he's saying? Which businesses have you worked with?

There's a vast difference between F50 and FAANG compensation:

*  Wells Fargo (F47) software developer: L3 (senior software engineer), 6 total years experience in the company, $133k total comp.
* Meta E5 software developer, 7 years total experience, $405k total comp.

Your F50 experience is nowhere representative of the pay scale for FAANG SWEs, it looks like.

Above it all, I'm quite surprised at the negativity hurled at this dude. It's like this sub is filled by a ton of bitter people who can't be happy for others."
koy39ty,Chreed96,4,,1707088038,happy," Those are like the senior senior engineers at FAANG living in SF. No one makes that much before 30 in a city where your rent isn't like 60k/year. I went to college near the bay area and people bragged about getting jobs at Twitter making 150k right out of college. But after taxes, rent, and transportation it was less thab my 70k."
koughez,aster__,12,,1707027394,happy," Airbnb is one example. Requires 3 years for a few senior roles (not all but a few) and still pays >400k. Gotta be really good and have gone to MIT, Stanford, etc usually. Not always the case but that’s usually what i see."
koufz35,Thekijael,6,,1707027079,happy," Also important to note, senior engineer roles don’t pay that much. Direct roles don’t even pay that much."
kovxcsl,Master_Stress_3009,14,,1707060003,happy, Stock is different from salary
kouy9qf,Mother_Airline8301,7,,1707039789,happy," These numbers are standard for FAANGs and other unicorns in VHCOL locations, especially if you were hired when stock was low. It’s no doubt that market conditions are bad now for hiring, but that’s another story. Salaries are still huge."
kouiiyq,aster__,2,,1707028688,happy," They do. Some companies cut their bands for new hires by 10-15% (like my company) but i can assure you, they very much exist

Edit: ill agree one definitely shouldn’t join software engineering expecting these numbers though. Extremely hard to obtain but they definitely do exist"
kovonk6,jeff303,2,,1707056353,happy," They're completely believable, if counting base salary plus RSUs."

kov122t,FunAd5449,8,,1707041828,happy, I believe your attitude is one of many reasons why YOU will never make this much before 30 if at all. Cheers!
koyt3xb,chicagodude84,1,,1707098425,happy," I don’t believe it's about bitterness. It's more about the way he presented his salary, which comes off as bragging. Sure, it's impressive and good for him for achieving that. However, discussing such a high salary  (one that's out of reach for many), can come across as tactless.

 It's great that he's successful, but there's a way to share success without seeming to flaunt it, especially in a context where such earnings are far from the norm for most."

kon9kkn,BrendaBaumer,99,,1706908774,happy," I stopped getting frozen food like pizza, chicken tenders, and fries and stopped eating out. I stopped buying snacky foods and just stuff that required actually cooking because I'm lazy and I won't wanna cook when I'm peckish which helped me to only eat at meal times.

I also stayed away from foods with a lot of fat or simple carbs like spaghetti and meats, which is usually a staple of mine. Along those lines, I research the best foods for liver disease, which are vegetables (duh), complex carbs like potatoes and rice, and legumes like beans and lentils. I made a lot of meatless chili, minestrone, beef and potato soup sans the beef, and lentil stew. To cut down on sugar, I switched to oatmeal with berries for breakfast (I highly recommend getting the quaker quick oats, you can cook them in the microwave for a minute or two and they're better than usual oatmeal.) For lunch I usually had some sort of beans and rice dish.

Also! It's okay to not go cold turkey on eating junk food! It's hard and gives you sugar and fat cravings, so just slowly easy yourself into eating healthier so that you won't be tempted to relapse.

Another thing I did was get smaller dishes, like European portion size bowls that Americans use as ice cream bowls. This really helped me eat less. Also they're cute.

If somewhere I was going was within a few miles or less of me, I would walk instead of drive. I'm still pysching myself up to go to the gym, one of these days I'll get the courage to go.

Sorry for being long winded, I hope this helps!"
kuzw4q7,OverallMinute429,1,,1710513383,happy," Have you looked into milk thistle and dandelion root? 
I was literally dying of liver failure in 2020 and everyone just wanted me on meds. 

I had a 1 year old and fought for my life! Literally. I went to herbal medications because I was having serious thoughts of harming myself and others. I was also dealing with untreated PPD Pyshcosis.

Long story short herbs are what saved me and proper nutrition. You can reverse the damage!"
kox3mje,BrendaBaumer,1,,1707075102,happy," I had grade 1. I'm lucky because we caught it super quickly: I don't usually drink but I decided to randomly and half a beer later I had to rush the ER due to intense abdominal pain. They measured my AST as 140 and my ALT as 187 (not superrr high but still not great), and the scans flagged my liver as both fatty and enlarged, and my primary gave me the diagnosis later that month. 

However! Grade 2 and 3 fatty liver and fibrosis can largely, even completely, be reversed, [Medical Article ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5339475/#:~:text=Early%20liver%20fibrosis%2C%20which%20lacks,is%20successfully%20treated%20%5B70%5D.). For grade 4, I don't think cirrhosis can be fully cured, but the current evidence supports that lifestyle changes can slow it down a lot

Edit: to add, if you're ever feeling discouraged, remember: the liver is basically the most resilient organ in the body and can regrow itself completely even if 70% of it is removed. You just gotta give 'er time and a lil help to get there!

Edit 2: I got the grades messed up. Grade 3 could also be largely reversed. Grade 4 is cirrhosis."

kor5if7,HamboneBanjo,3,,1706977977,happy," If you’re looking for a quick intermittent workouts, may I recommend putting on an occasional just dance video on YouTube? I do longer cardio workouts every day after work (about 4-7 songs), but sometimes I’ll throw one on as a pick me up if I’m feeling sluggish or otherwise down. My favorite is probably Hey Ya, but I’ve been doing an LMFAO one (I can feel this one in my abs) and a Justin Timberlake one. Another good brief workout is to lean against a counter and do push-ups. I try to knock out 25 real quick when I feel anxious. Sometimes I’ll throw in another 10 or so of the diamond ones."
konnxe5,BrendaBaumer,10,,1706913561,happy," Yes please, I'd love to hear any advice you can share!"
konz1u9,Corporateblondy93,14,,1706917894,happy," So I had a hard time getting motivated to work out too. I finally decided I needed to enjoy my workouts so I downloaded an app called ClassPass (I can give you my code if you wanna try) and I started taking different classes to get workouts in. It seriously changed my life. I fell in love with boxing, barre and yoga, and it gave me the confidence to start going to the gym to start lifting and take up pole dancing as well.

So many people think you have to go to the gym and do x x and x. I think as long as you’re moving your body you’re doing well. Find an exercise that you like, the more enjoyable it is the more likely you’ll stick with it!"

kp62ddu,sadphrogs,2,,1707222163,happy, I think since its a bonus and considered “supplemental income” it is taxes higher.
koiyl60,sadphrogs,14,,1706838132,happy," I like buying stuff for other people so I’ll probably do that with some of it! Already bought valentine stuff for my niece and nephew and I gotta get some birthday presents so it’s nice to have some extra money for that. There is also a local cafe near me that specifically hires and helps people with disabilities, so I am gonna try to stop in and grab some of their coffee and leave a nice tip when I get a chance!!

After that, I’m probably just gonna throw the rest of it into my savings account. My laptop recently died so I had to use a decent chunk of my savings to buy a new one which hurt my soul. I also spent so much money on christmas presents this year, so this is super nice to finally be able to get my savings back up :)"

So we discussed it with her, and she decided to drop photography.  The school said no, but after much discussion they backed down.. she passed her remaining courses with flying colours after much hard work,  and she's in a far better place now."

kjyrtws,curliegirlie89,1,,1706458363,happy," 5 pages of formatting rules is excessive! It might be a time for someone to talk to the Dean about this professor. Formatting is important. If the professor has formatting preferences to help him read/grade or it’s expected in the profession you and other students have chosen, then ok. I get it but there is no way that many rules is necessary and it sounds like he’s on a power trip. The Dean needs to know about this, even if it just an anonymous packet that contains his five pages of formatting rules so that he’s aware there’s a problem and can talk to him about raining it in. Unfortunately, if the professor has tenure, the university, can’t fire him. However, obtaining tenure status is becoming extremely hard for professors to obtain for this very reason."

kjtty3l,Primary-Initiative52,4,,1706375697,happy," Teaching high school science was a second career for me.  I had one of THOSE days...and as I stood in the wreck of my classroom at the end of the day I reminded myself that I DID have options, I could leave the profession if I wanted and go back to what I used to do.  Maybe five seconds in to this contemplation I thought...""Nah.  I love this.  I'm NEVER bored!""  I had a blast (sometimes literally, teaching chemistry) teaching high school sciences.  Every day was new, every day was different.  I feel very fortunate to have had that career."

kjm6t4v,Awkward_Courage5,1,,1706245080,happy," Welcome and congratulations! I recall the day my father received his US Citizenship. There was nothing more important to him that day than the fact that he was now officially a US citizen with the right to vote! It is not an easy feat to obtain this citizenship, I can say firsthand, as I have watched both my parents and my older sister go through the process. But it is definitely worth it once you've completed it because now it's done! All done! 
Congratulations, once more, on a journey worth making. May your stay here always be a pleasant one. ❤️"

kjfwy6r,MadTownMich,5,,1706148053,happy," Congratulations on liking your job and the promotion! Sounds like you have a very bright future. As an older person (over 50), my suggestion is to just learn your new position and do a great job. They already think highly of you. Don’t worry about next steps for a while. If more promotions are in order, consider them carefully based on the culture in your bank. Some places are perfectly fine with a great employee turning down a promotion for personal reasons. Others will expect you to take them or move on. One of my brothers decided to halt the promotion train after several promotions because his company required him to move, and he wanted his kids to stay put. They were very clear with him that if he didn’t accept a promotion, he would not have another chance. He was fine with that, and they have held to that too. A bit weird in my opinion to not consider temporary life circumstances, but at least they were transparent. Take some time to figure out your personal priorities. You’re in a great position."
kjhrx5d,Towel_Fuzzy,1,,1706185318,happy," Thank you, I appreciate it. Been a tough little journey but it's all part of the process I just struggle being content if that makes sense. So I'm always looking for new opportunities to advance and go forward. You're right and I'll slow down a little and enjoy my position and rock it out. That is very weird, it's almost like a pouty move in my opinion, I'm glad he's doing great and I hope you are too. I appreciate your words, means a lot!"

Although in mine, I would sneak downstairs after my sisters had fallen asleep and my dad was shaving, getting ready for work. He would lather up my face and we would shave together. It makes it all the more special that I am a female and he didn't say anything. I knew my mom didn't shave, so I knew I didn't need to. He just knew I wanted to do something that was spending time together with him."

kixke53,irowells1892,8,,1705866610,happy," This is so wholesome! Your mom sounds lovely.

My mom and I ran a resale/vintage booth together for a few years. We thrifted the items and cleaned them up to resell. Our favorite part was finding things and gifting them to the friends we met through our business! As in, someone would mention they needed a thing, or that they liked a certain type of thing, and if we had it we would just give it to them next time we saw them. It wasn't about the money as much as finding things that would have gone in the trash, and giving them a new home where they would be appreciated."
kixpg7r,GTFOofmybirthdayhous,7,,1705868361,happy," I love it! I am the mom in this situation and please know that if we can do things for you, we will. And we love to do it. She knows you appreciate it. But, it is always nice to hear it was appreciated and to get that hug. Really, that is all we want.   


My oldest kid is finishing a STEM ph.d program (debt free bc we started saving the month she was born). She always tells me she is s appreciative and she can never pay us back. I told her when she her first big paycheck after she  gets her ph.d I want to go out for a really fancy dinner on her bill and we will consider it even. We also told her to remember this when she has kids and make sure they are taken care of.   


My husband and I have five degrees between the two of us. Grad school was mostly paid for. But, we left college with $115,000 in student loans. I promised I would never do that to my kids.   


When your mom mentions something she likes take notes, really save it in your notes on your phone, and if not too expensive surprise her with those things on Christmas, Birthday or just because. She will know you are listening and appreciate her."

The illusion is that there is some normal out there and if we aren’t that image our brain has conceived then we aren’t normal.

But the most normal thing is to feel different, because everyone is different, even the people who seem the same."
kiw55q3,WorldsRealestMan,11,,1705848152,happy, Don't ever be ashamed of your natural hair. As a white guy it sickens me that many black women have insecurities about their hair. You are beautiful the natural way you are.

In the light pink background, I created falling leaves similar to those on the book covers. It might not be very clear in the photo, but they're there. I tried to incorporate as much information as I had about them into this drawing, like the choice of the song. It's a track that symbolizes their relationship, and the timestamp corresponds to the moment when the singer makes a love declaration. I'm really glad you noticed that reference!

He was a construction worker. He had a coffee, a pastry, a pack of cigarettes and an energy drink. His card declined. 

He ran out to the truck across the parking lot to get money. I told the cashier ""I got this."" And just paid for all of his stuff and mine as fast as I could (I have terrible social anxiety) and hauled ass out of the store. 

It made me feel great. Like a good fairy or something.

Iike someone at home isn’t feeling so well.” I thanked him, skipped in front of him, and briefly mentioned my little boy had a pretty bad cold. When the cashier told me my total, which was probably just 15 dollars or so, the gentleman that let me ahead of him in line stepped up and paid (I had the money) and said “you seem like a good mom. My mother was kind like you too, we lost her recently. Go home and take care of your little guy. I’ll pay for your things.” I couldn’t believe it.

kikzrb6,Autam,44,,1705669792,happy," Its not a clean bill of health yet. Last year I started having seizures and mobility problems and they thought it was my heart causing it. Now they’ve found it’s not my heart and they referred me to a neurologist. I’m just glad to be out of that thing lol

I hope everything goes good with your wife. I hope things get better  for her"

kimxzkt,Autam,4,,1705694649,happy," Yeah, they are like that. One wrong move and the it starts screaming at you. I was gonna get a ICD put in. We had a date and everything then they called and said they were wrong it’s not my heart and I don’t have to wear it anymore. Happy about that but also sucks cause we still don’t know what’s wrong"
kikt15l,Autam,17,,1705666266,happy," Yeah lol I took it down after an hour cause I figured if it doesn’t work out it’ll be an embarrassing post. I’ll just wait to celebrate till it’s a for sure thing, you know?"

kilanv6,Autam,12,,1705674424,happy," The other story was I might be writing for a newsletter online. Very true, I posted about it then deleted it less than an hour later because it’s not official yet and I didn’t want ti get ahead of myself. 

Yes, I am sick. I struggled with alcoholism for years and about six months after getting sober I started having seizures, vision distortions, and slowly loosening my ability to walk on my own. They’re pretty sure the drinking is something that causes it.  At this point, I haven’t been able to leave my house in over a month while I wait for neurologist to figure out what’s going on. I’ve been admitted to the hospital 6 times so far this year. 

You know, it’s not impossible for someone to have more than one thing going on. I write articles, and I’m sick. Being as I can’t leave my house so much, I’ve been able to work on my articles a lot more."

kilhk7a,TheMixerTheMaster,14,,1705677035,happy, She’s doing much better. Thank you. That’s crazy. The moment that I knew something was really wrong was when she started seizing. Have they diagnosed anything neurologically?

kikz97v,Autam,5,,1705669550,happy, I think he’s saying it because I posted a selfie a couple days ago but then deleted it less than an hour later because it was celebrating I might get to write for this newsletter but it’s not a for sure thing so I figured I should wait to celebrate. Other than that the only other selfi I posted was a few weeks ago celebrating that after years of struggling with alcoholism I finally made it over a year sober

kioguj0,Fievelinstyle,3,,1705714801,happy," I'm honestly lucky, his (soon to be ex) wife alienated him from everyone! He didn't have a single friend outside of his brother who treats him like an ATM. I happened to find him and befriend him at the exact time he needed it. 

Honestly. I think it's because he's older, 50 compared to my 30, and a lot of older people just don't really know or understand abusive relationships. Which was the problem for him. He didn't know he was being abused. 

Than I come waltzing in with all my therapy knowledge and now he's going to get better."

kioiqw9,Fievelinstyle,3,,1705715565,happy," Thank you 😭

What really set me off last night was that my friend was desperately needing help. A 30 year marriage fell apart because he figured out he was being abused. He went to relationship advice on here and people blamed HIM for her cheating, they called him a door mat, told him he was an idiot. 

Oh gosh. I was so angry!! He cried so many times last night because of that on top of everything else. Seeing the strong, sweet, honest person break like that just killed me. 

So I agree with you!! It's frustrating!! Thank you, I don't think I'm exactly a good person but I sure as fuck want to save him however I can. 😤"
kiq9kps,Fievelinstyle,2,,1705752779,happy, Thank you!! That makes him really happy. 🥰

But cheating is NEVER the other person's fault.  It was my fault that my wife left, but not for the cheating.

Sadly, some people are just assholes, thankfully there are fewer assholes than average or good people.  We just REALLY notice the bad as they stand out."
kiokfg3,Fievelinstyle,1,,1705716251,happy," It's just so infuriating, I know people are, like, always gonna do it but boy howdy did it get under my skin fr this time lol

Right??? She cheated on him and told him it was because he was broken. Truth is he's greysexual and just don't like woman. Religious marriage be like that tho. I'm sorry about your wife, man. You seem awesome though 

Yeah you got me there! I'm happy I ain't an asshole. Couldn't imagine living a life like that lol"
kiol0ee,JamesWjRose,2,,1705716490,happy," I have my good aspects, and my bad.  My bad ONLY come out after someone has fucked me over, and then they ALWAYS deflect like me being pissed isn't their fault.

That's what his ex is doing, blaming him for her defect.  It's rather a simple, and stupid thing humans do.

Anyway, my ship is leaving port and I'll likely not have Internet soon.

You guys try to have a peaceful weekend"

By gradually losing the weight do you have less excess skin?

PS you look incredible!"

You just have to do something about a gap on one side, as the trim on one side is attached to the moving part of the door. My solution was to tape off the door edge, fill in the gap with drywall mud, sand flush, and paint it. I don't really know if that's the best solution.

khx2rrx,roberttheaxolotl,3,,1705290352,happy," It's a latch meant for a fence gate, with a cable pull that goes to the opposite side. I bought a fake book that's a box to hide items in. Drilled a hole, and fed the cable through, with a washer to not damage the book. It goes through a hole in the door to the latch."

khptulm,GivingItMyBest,2,,1705178561,happy," ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" I love. The mix of colours works well together and isn't overwelming. It's great. I feel like it can be inturpated many ways too. A tree in a dream. A tree under a waterfall. A magic tree. A tree in a wonderful fantasy world. If I look at it on it's side with the bright yellow bit the side on the bottom, it looks like a beautiful lake with a branch reaching out over it and flowers floating along. If I flip it the other way I see blue mountains with a colourful magical sky and clouds. It'#s really quite fasinating to me."

khlp9bm,iartnewyork,36,,1705106894,happy," That's such an interesting perspective! Thank you for sharing that with me because you're right, I paint from the unconscious, spontaneously, without foresight into the final result or ultimate subject matter so it's like a dream....it unfolds as it happens in the moment. Thank you!"
khoiz78,Huge_Statistician441,4,,1705161763,happy, Ya! Those are incredibly beautiful! They remind me of an abstract about a Disney princess (rapunzel for the first one and Belle for the second).
khlddne,iartnewyork,9,,1705102233,happy," Thank you! I'm happy you connected with it! She commissioned the piece in terms of colors and dimensions but gave me full autonomy to produce whatever ideas emerged in my consciousness (imagination). I haven't done more than 2 commissioned paintings, so it was somewhat intimidating, but I kept repeating the same mantra: ""She's going to love this,"" as I painted, and sure enough, she did! Very happy for both of us! 🥲😊🙏✨️"

khl84d7,iartnewyork,11,,1705100227,happy," Thank you so much! It was nerve-wracking because I sent the pictures to her and then she went silent for days....with no way of knowing if she liked the work and what would happen....the suspense was unbearable! So when she finally texted and apologized and said she loved it, I could exhale the tension. The other buyer was more communicative but it was still pretty intense until the last minute. Thank goodness it all ended well and we are all happy!! I just shipped them so they're on their way! ✨️🥳🥰✨️🖼✨️💕 Thanks again for your kindness and thoughtful reply 🙏 😊"

khlm5eo,iartnewyork,9,,1705105660,happy," That's so nice of you to say! Thank you 😊 🙏 💓 Funny enough, she (the buyer in LA) commissioned it and now that I've seen that I can do it, I'm considering doing another one just because it was so much fun to produce! It's 18""w x 24""h, acrylic on canvas, and she paid in two installments. We spoke on the phone last night and she asked about adding more flowers, and I said sure. She was right because it looks way better with the edges filled in! ✨️🖼✨️"
khmi9pq,iartnewyork,3,,1705119232,happy, Not weird at all! I've battled anxiety since I was a kid (aggressive parents who were unsafe to be around) so I empathize with you. Thank you for sharing!

And yes! Funny you should ask because I loved working on her piece (the purple one) so much that I am actually eager to paint one like it asap 💜 😄 Every painting is unique so if/when I do another one like that it may look similar but would be it's own special production and image. ✨️🖼💕✨️"

khv83kr,iartnewyork,2,,1705265903,happy," Thank you so much! And I would recommend you keep trying because this has been a journey of practice for me. If you tell your subconscious mind that you are great, it cannot disagree. It has to obey. So it will help you achieve that goal. All you have to do is make the effort. You'll get there if you focus and contribute to your own efforts little by little because that's all it takes. 🥰🙏✨️💖✨️🖼✨️"

Overall, what made my mornings so much better was not looking at my phone right away. I keep my phone in a separate place that is NOT my nightstand, so I literally have to get up to get it.

khfr7xe,Papancasudani,16,,1705015329,happy," Several years ago I started practicing loving-kindness meditation where you focus on wishes of wellbeing and happiness towards other people. At one point I started doing it daily for a month, just to see what would happen. I didn’t notice much myself but then I noticed that people started responding more positively to me. I wasn’t doing anything intentionally different, but at one point I realized I was smiling more at people. It was authentic, not forced, and automatic because I really felt more positive toward people. It was interesting to see such a change in such a a short time."
khfvdli,Halogen12,7,,1705016924,happy," Preach it.  So so so true.  I used to walk through my neighborhood for an hour nearly every day and made sure to make eye contact with people, smile and say hello or make small talk in passing, like about the weather or their cute dog.  Everyone's face lit up.  Everyone needs to be seen and acknowledged and smiled at.  It's harder to do these days, as now when I go out for walks people coming toward me have their heads down or just stare straight ahead, looking completely resistant and uninterested in a moment of interaction.  Oh well."

khhk18u,mapleleaffem,2,,1705044068,happy," A smile is a powerful thing! I usually work alone and have to go to to many different places, often in sketchy areas. The best approach is walking confidently, making eye contact and smiling (even if I’m worried I’m about to get rolled lol). If they don’t smile back it’s a useful warning"
khhmkfe,ursoevil,2,,1705045790,happy, I feel that I could really practice this. How does it work? Do you just think positive thoughts in your head when you see random people on the streets or do you dedicate time to sit down and meditate with these thoughts?
khi3op1,lalauna,2,,1705058138,happy," Loving kindness meditation makes me happy, too. I'm still having trouble maintaining it while driving on the freeway, though. It's a work in progress"
khjo8x6,Papancasudani,2,,1705081317,happy," both. There are plenty of instructions and guided meditations online. so as a formal meditation session, you set some time aside, bring a person to mind, and typically mentally recite phrases that wish good things for them. So, for example, “may you be happy and well may you be at peace.” it’s easier to do with people we like, like people who’ve done good things for us, good friends, etc. Eventually you can try neutral people, people you don’t know, and you feel neither positive nor negative. As an advanced practice, you can do it towards people you don’t like, but that requires a certain way of framing things in order to make it work and not feel forced. 

But then I do it all day long as well., or at least, as often as I can remember. Sometimes I set a timer to go off randomly once an hour to remind me. It can be a general statement like “may all beings beings everywhere be happy and well.”, and/or you can just briefly wish it towards people you come across, mentally, wishing it for them momentarily.  

But, the foundation of all of this, however, is to wish it for yourself as well. The happier and healthier you are, the more capable and willing you will be to help others. So it’s not the least bit selfish. We can’t help people very much if we’re sick, exhausted, and demoralized. But being as happy and healthy as we can be allows us to be more patient, motivated, and less stressed when help is needed. so you can take time just wishing it to yourself, and/or you can include yourself in all of the wishes, e.g. “may we all be happy and well”."
khjmsnv,Papancasudani,1,,1705080845,happy," I call it driving-kindness. lol. I keep it simple like, “May we all reach our destinations safely”."
khjy671,ursoevil,1,,1705084581,happy, Thank you that’s very informative for how to get a start on it. I’ll look for more resources online too. It sounds like a wholesome way to live.

kha4v90,TwoStoryLife,6,,1704928201,happy," my wife's favorite artist and song is George Strait and Amarillo By Morning. I had a 60-80 minute commute at the time and decided to practice that song and sing it at karaoke. we never went to any bar withkaraoke for months so one night I wanted to show her how much I love her and I told her my surprise. 

All the blood drained out of her face and she said ""oh no. don't do that"" like I'd just said I've always wanted to taste human flesh.

so my gift to her is to not replace George's version with my bad one in her head."

I love singing, and I would LOVE to sing to hubs in public (or private), but I KNOW I wouldn’t be able to control my emotions, and would just burst out crying (with overwhelming love).  I know this, because I cry just thinking about it.  In fact, I don’t even have to be singing to him-if he were in the room and I sang a song even remotely about love, I’d turn into a blubbering mess. In fact, I’m listening to one of my favorite Alicia Keys songs to sing (If I Ain’t Got You), just thinking about him, and tears are running down my face.  Been married 22 years ❤️"

But it's okay, you don't have to beat yourself about it. We were all pick-mes at some point.

I can only imagine how hard it must be to get out of bed daily and participate in this world. It's an amazing decision to prioritize your mental health and I can certainly assure you, you're not the first one to stop working due to stress. 

At the end of the day, you need money to fulfill your basic needs and create some moments of happiness. Given your current situation, you can rely on your family/friends to  meet your needs (partially) and create moments of happiness together. You can definitely find a source of income in the future, but you should focus on yourself now and enjoy the company of your loved ones :)

Just like the members said, you can seek more help in other subreddits. Good luck!"

No matter how rich or plenty of money you have our time on this earth is limited. You can't even buy and bring back the life of loved ones that you lost along the way. 


My advice to you, drop the materialism, jealousy, social pressure, let go of pride and ego.  Instead be grateful for the things and people you have. Enjoy the moment, enjoy life, appreciate small things. Even the gift of living and breathing is priceless."

kh5da33,growbot_3000,1,,1704853018,happy," Buddhism teaches some good stuff. General meditation can also help without looking into any Buddhist ideas but as an inquisitive person I've found much understanding about myself and the world from pondering their views.
But in general just accepting things as they are and doing what you can for the better of it all help give solace to the feeling of what you speak. And I'm 47 and been through it many times probably at least once a decade haha but you just learn the flow after so long. Idk, were all different but as a species we've learned what works and what doesn't.

Another way is simple communion with nature as a grounding element. Mushrooms can help haha but you know just take care of yourself because you can and deserve to and celebrate being alive and having fortuitous opportunities that many don't.

Gratitude and accountability are good tokens to keep nearby as well. 

You got this homie, I believe in you 💯"

kh0kbxa,karasutraaa,57,,1704779291,happy," Honestly, today I was at Target and spend over $100 on groceries. I told my man, “I remember when all of this was just $80 back when we first got together.” Then boom the checkout alerts me I have over $40 in target rewards. I haven’t checked my rewards in eons. So I apply it and bam amount is at $82. It was wild because it was like I called it out and then it happened. 
And my energy today at work felt a lot better than it has at the end of last year. Last year was not a good year for me mentally. I was lost in my mind. 
When we got home from target, we expected to not have a parking spot out front by our apartment because our neighborhood has no parking. Usually if you leave anywhere after 4 PM, your spot is taken and you have to walk a block or so just to get to your apartment. We were sure it would be the same tonight. We pull up and there is an open spot right in front of our apartment. Which was amazing because we had to buy a lot of groceries and cat litter tonight. 
Needless to say, the start of this year seems like a good omen for once. The past couple of years didn’t feel this way at all. 
Then I saw your post! 
I know these are small things but they made me happy. So yeah, I agree with you. It seems cliche to admit, but I’m feeling like this is my year. And I will do everything in my power to make it my year as well!!"

kgpi5sb,No-Bid5498,3,,1704616876,happy, Gratitude. Ever in the hard times you can always find something to be thankful for. I used to keep a gratitude journal (I need to again). I would write 3 things I was grateful for that day. It couldn’t be the same thing that I had written before. It made a huge difference!

I've got several makery hobbies to choose from, from assembling off-brand Legos to heat press/sublimating tshirts to 3D printing & painting tchotchkes for my shelves. I used to write or draw, but there's something very soothing about taking your bad feelings and using them to make a physical object that you can admire long after you forget what inspired its creation."

khd12a2,TPieces,1,,1704981226,happy," I think that you can't maintain a state of happiness all the time, and I think by trying to do so you can sabotage your holistic quality-of-life. There are lots of resources about the hedonic treadmill, etc. It's important to manage our expectations and learn to appreciate the down times as much as we can, even if they're impossible to ""enjoy"" strictly speaking. That said, I'm on meds and I do as much as I can to keep out of despair--exercise, meditation, gratitude, all that jazz. These things really do help."

khest8a,TPieces,2,,1705003365,happy," Make it count! Get a real bank account (or a CREDIT UNION account) and DEPOSIT THAT SHIT. And I want people to enjoy things and I know it's judgy but dude don't spend it on the PS5--not only is that a whole chunk of textbooks (or security deposit, or tuition, whatever it's 5 bills that's real money) but it will also suck up the time you need to be spending on school! My wife teaches college and sees people blow their financial aid all sorts of ways and it makes her really sad. Don't make my wife sad. Also, dudes ruin their education gaming ALL THE TIME it's crazy. If you fail out you definitely will miss that aid."

I’d spent my whole life caring for others and ignoring my own wants and needs- then one day I had a change of heart and began doing things for myself, whether others approved or not.

kgi5au2,ranzdalf,1,,1704495453,happy, But i mean she just sent me a smooching emoji after i sent her a compliment About her being productive and busy today after she talkedeherself down. So now I'm even more confused....
kgi067q,ranzdalf,1,,1704493611,happy," Yeah 100%, my friend who's never had a relationship or female friends doesn't understand they are just people as well. Being genuine with women has been tougher than with men and i have my prejudice for sure but the ones I've met i can genuinely talk with and won't judge have been the most wonderful people in my Life. I found that not a lot of women will understand me the way men will but if you find a woman to understand you it's more precious than gold because they'll give you advice like no man ever could."

Like bro it's been fucking heaven. She cheated on me. I almost killed myself. Was in the psychward for 5 days. Man. It was hard. You'll find someone else. I found someone else. Second time ever since Actually. The person after that was just Friends with benefits. I've felt like shit for quite a while, not a long time compared to others but just not been myself for some time. Thinking about suicide to this day but man. Lifes gonna go on and on and on just matters what you yourself are doing. You're putting the effort that's reasonable for you to put in or even more in? Nothing to beat yourself up over. Got people that you need to be there for? Don't beat yourself up over small things. Lifes just difficult. That's it"

kk8cw6l,MissChemistryNerd,2,,1706601886,happy, Thank you so very much!!! I know this is very late but it’s been a crazy month and I forgot Reddit existed. Thank you again for the encouragement!!!
kk8czu5,MissChemistryNerd,1,,1706601958,happy, Thank you!! And I don’t actually deal with books or book narration. I apologize—my specialty is character voice acting. I’d suggest just making sure you have an echo-free recording area and a nice XLR microphone if you’re planning on narrating it yourself. Even an AT2020 would be fine!

kfs8g94,AkediaIra,1,,1704075777,happy," I'm so so proud of you! I have never had an issue with substance abuse or addiction, but I'm on long term neuroleptic drugs to control narcolepsy and bipolar. 24 hours without my venlifaxine and I feel like shit. My head feels like a red hot poker has been shoved into it, I'm throwing up, I shake violently. I derive no emotional benefits from my medication, it's not something that is common in public, it's not connected to lifestyle, and I still feel like I'm going to die when I don't take it. 

I can't imagine how difficult it was to quit alcohol. It's a constant presence in life, your friends probably all drink, your family, it's on TV, it's in every restaurant, and you still did it. Congratulations!"

Realized years later I was using it to cope with her passing. I met my wife 7 years ago, and went through lent together, giving up alcohol for those 40 some odd days. Dried me out, and haven't had a taste for it since. I'm very thankful that she opened my eyes. Keep it up, stay strong and above all else, be happy!"

One of them lay down on a road junction as we were crossing and *would not get up*. My brother in law just stood there kind of politely pleading with it while all the other alpacas considered lying down in solidarity. 10/10 family bonding moment, can recommend 😂🦙"

kfqnxqd,,3,,1704052761,happy," They both spit. The lady told us that alpacas have two types of spit. One were they fire off lots of little ones to tell us to move away. The other, a big spit to really tell us to move away. They also only have teeth on their lower jaw. 

Spit free trip. Wouldn’t have minded though, I was enamoured (: 

It’s certainly given me a nice memory to end the year on and carry into the new one."

kfuompj,theyreall_throwaways,1,,1704128703,happy," Glad it was a spit free trip! I guess they liked being around you. I remember reading that one of them had extremely bad smelling spit. Like you wash it off and yet the smell is still there. I think it was a petty revenge story of a petting zoo worker. 

Best I can remember these teens had been aggravating the animals, not following rules etc. the employee warned them to stop bothering the llama/alpaca and that they will spit in defence. The animal spit on them and they found it funny. Like you said, there's a warning spit, and then a more serious one. They kept bothering the animal, and it did it's defensive spit. One of them threw up bc the smell was so bad. 

Anyhow, glad your visit was happy and stink free."

It's digital loans, but it's nice bc there is a wait-list; sometimes I'll get an alert that a book is available that I forgot about. I would rather have a physical book, but I'll happily take a free digital loan. Not sure if similar things are available in other countries.

I’d recommend “tying the knot” and asking her officially something like “I’ve really been enjoying our time together, would you be my girlfriend?” It sounds cheesy but my girlfriend loveeeeed it when I did that. It also creates an official anniversary date!"

kffh6mf,YaHaWaHa,-2,,1703867316,happy," Cancer is garbage collection bag for the body, to safely store the poisons, so that it can be eliminated later, at a time when the elimination channels are functioning properly.

When we poke our nose into it, and steal the garbage bag or spill the contents of the garbage bag, body has no choice but to create a new garbage bag or multiple garbage bags as the body cannot survive without the garbage bag.

The proper way to deal with the garbage bag is to help the body free up it's channels of elimination, so that it can slowly throw out the garbage over a period of time.

There will be a stage when the garbage bag/cancer is no longer necessary, as there is no garbage to hold onto as the elimination channels are functioning properly and the intake of garbage both physical as well as emotional has stopped."

I was thinking of getting a new series iPad that can run the swift compiler/programming suite and start doing the nitty gritty"
kfi3n0x,JedahVoulThur,3,,1703903534,happy," For many years I tried multiple different engines, and all of them have some positives depending on the project you want to make. 

For my released game I used one called Godot. I found it very intuitive and fast to learn. 

I'm not versed in exporting to iOS though, I'm from a country where Apple products in general aren't popular. But I remember it was available among the options.

I recommend looking for a YouTube tutorial series, there are many great ones that teach the basics and be persistent, it's not easy but it isn't impossible either.

Good luck with that!"

kfhfirq,taniamorse85,8,,1703893493,happy," I think what I gave my mom for Christmas this year was the best gift I've given someone.

&#x200B;

Her knee arthritis has been getting worse this year, but it particularly has worsened in the past couple months.  She's even fallen multiple times because of it.  Every once in a while, she has asked to borrow my quad cane.  While I certainly don't mind her using it from time to time, I need it pretty often myself.

&#x200B;

So, I did some research and found a quad cane that I was reasonably sure would fit her needs.  Then, one day she asked me if I would help her find a quad cane.  She could not have been more shocked when I told her I had ordered one already, and it was scheduled to arrive the next day.

&#x200B;

She's had it for a little over 3 weeks so far, and it has vastly improved her mobility and safety.  It does have everything she needs in a cane, and she noticed it also had a wrist loop, which I hadn't even considered.  My cane doesn't have one, but she likes that hers does."

kf3qjwt,PharmMouse,466,,1703669431,happy," So some backstory. The Boy was about 16,17 when I met him. His mom had walked out on him and his dad when he was young. His stepmother ended up cheating on his dad and during the separation didnt have anything to do with him.

I never played any maternal role to him but I was his biggest fan. Hes smart, talented, and most of all hes kind. I just know he's going to accomplish great things someday. 

Unfortunately things ended between me and his father when he caught COVID and it affected him so bad neurologically he was no longer the same person. The hard working family man I once dated now has a few DUIs, charges for assault on a female, resisting arrest etc. If I didnt know any better I wouldve said it was drugs but no, I saw what the rona did to him.

The Boys mom ended up moving to Japan right before he went to college and his dads gone quite insane and I just feel awful for him. So every few months I reach out just so he knows hes got someone in his corner. 

I had started to feel like it was just something he tolerated so to receive this message and know that he tried to connect with me while he was in town really really meant a lot. Unfortunately I was working and he had plans in the city later but maybe next time!"
kf3yy64,roseyyz,54,,1703675894,happy," Thanks for reaching out for this young man. You are a nice person, this is so important for him as you might be the only adult he looks up to, like you already noticed. Glad you are still there for him, please continue this beautiful journey, who knows if this guy might end up being your favorite person in the future 💝"
kf4r3b9,karenw,39,,1703690772,happy," I have a ""bonus kid"" who was friends with my son in middle school. They're all around 30 now, but he came to my house on Christmas morning to open his stocking.

He gives me far more credit than I think I deserve for being a solid presence in his life all these years. I hope you and the boy remain in touch."

kf5rp3q,heymookie,13,,1703704125,happy, As a child of divorce who grew very attached to many of my parents partners over the years….this is beautiful. You probably mean a lot more to this kid than you’ll ever realize. And to be a constant in their life for THAT long…it’s been detrimental to their development and well being. There’s no doubt in my mind this kid thinks about you often.
kf54i7x,Pretentious_bat,10,,1703695858,happy," You’re doing great. It seems he wanted some family time for Christmas (based on your comment it doesn’t seem he gets it from his bio fam). If you’re comfortable, could you invite him over for some post Christmas celebration? Or maybe next Christmas? It sounds to me like he tried going to yours 🥲"
kf56c35,Ok-Win5980,3,,1703696519,happy, Was he hospitalized with COVID? I’m very curious how void could have affected him that way

kf913g3,Visible_Print_578,1,,1703759193,happy," So happy for both of you. 
I have a 24 year old bonus daughter (sounds better than stepdaughter if you ask me). Known her all her life, but her dad and me always had a rollercoaster relationship and broke up for good about nine years ago. I text her and tell her that I'm proud of her or miss her. We don't meet very often, her mother is dead and her dad and her don't have a good relationship. 
Yesterday she told me that she is so happy to know that me and her grandmother is always there. Made me so happy and warm."

kg37flz,CGisglutenfree,2,,1704259302,happy," I’m realizing that losing your mind bc Covid is scary common… if you or anyone knows people that relate, I would ask if they had bloodwork panels at a GI or autoimmune specialist. “Long COVID” for me was an autoimmune disease; it triggered celiac disease that tanked my hormones/absorption rates for vitamins and nutrients/mood regulation. 

OP is rad for being there for those kids, and I’m sorry for your partner’s experience… being on either end is a mental and medical catastrophe; hoping everyone finds answers"
kf5a99s,Ok-Win5980,1,,1703697925,happy, Was it emotionally traumatizing for him to have COVID?

I wish you the best in your recovery. I feel like we are being globally gaslit about the harms of COVID."
kf5kwmq,Psychological-Wash18,10,,1703701709,happy," COVID can cause encephalitis, and encephalitis can cause behavior, personality, and memory problems. My dad doesn’t remember anything from the year he had Covid, and not much since then either ☹️"
kf72sec,PharmMouse,2,,1703721610,happy," Not that I can recall. He used to have a supernatural sniffer. One time my maid hid my weed and he was able to sniff it out of the drawer it was in. So when he lost his sense of smell I knew it was bad news. 

I went over one evening to find him passed out on the couch in his work clothes, with a homeless guy sitting at his dining room table. He didn't even stir when his 2 year old daughter woke up and came out so I put her back to bed. 

We used to have dinner at the neighbors frequently since they cooked exclusively on a smoker and they even noticed the difference. I'll be honest he was a little weird to begin with but it went to a whole new level. 

It really is tragic. He was a great father and a great boyfriend. Not only would he open the car door for me but hed buckle me in. He flew to MD with me to move my parents down to NC and waited til we got to the airport to reveal his fear of flying. He'd do anything to help someone out no question. 

3 years later and I'm still single because I havent found that same spark with anyone else. 

Last time I talked to his baby mama she told me hed pulled a gun on his gf in front of his daughter"
kf6lv8y,Nay_Nay_Jonez,3,,1703715016,happy, I have a brain tumor and a borderline case of idiopathic cranial hypertension and one of the primary reasons I am not messing with COVID is because of concerns about encephalitis. I'm sorry your dad went through that.

kf2465w,lalauna,7,,1703637386,happy," I lost my sweet husband last year in October. We'd been together for 36ish years. One thing I've found that, surprisingly, shuts off the tears and internal screaming for a while is to go shopping on TEMU. Minimum order is 10USD, so I've been able to do this retail therapy fairly often. I've bought more cheap earrings than anyone. Also kitchen gadgets. Silly presents for friends. Cat toys. Now I can just feel my husband giving me THAT look over his glasses. Hugs, everyone!"

kf2htdi,ZealousidealDingo594,3,,1703643306,happy, I was addicted to planning a Disney vacation when it looked like both my parents were about to pass (4 years later and they’re both with us) but it was something about choosing from a limited number of options that really made me happy. Gave me a sense of peace and control and some retail therapy. I never went! I’ll go one day with my kid but it was just a really nice “okay A or B” instead of the abyss of “what’s going to happen next???”
kf24btg,beanfalo,2,,1703637451,happy," I used to watch cake wars the Halloween and Christmas specials. They brought me a lot of joy seeing people so talented and passionate working as a team.

kf20meh,Nay_Nay_Jonez,6,,1703635883,happy," Thank you, I appreciate that. I love the Great British Bake Off!! I was definitely a Mary Berry/Sue/Mel fan, so I lost interest after Mary, Sue & Mel left. I did end up watching most of the Paul/Prue/Sandi/Noel seasons, but once Sandi left and Matt Lucas came on I dropped it completely. I see Noel has a new co-host now, so maybe I'll come back again!

The first season of GBBO that I watched was when Nadiya Hussain won and holy cow, talk about a joyful moment! Even just thinking about her shock when she (so deservedly won) gets me a little teary! I'll need to track it down on TV for a re-watch, especially since I'll be having surgery next week and will be laid up for awhile. I might even pony up for a brief Netflix subscription or whatever service it's on."

kew9ey7,periodicsheep,2,,1703532966,happy," good for you for pushing yourself into something new! that’s awesome and healthy. i have weird vision stuff too, the one time i went shooting i struggled a little bit."
kewcl1d,havik09,2,,1703534365,happy," Yeah I've always been good. First day first deer first shot where I was aiming at the deer and it was dropped.   I won't tell it all but 3 mis fires and I have all my toes.  12 years old.  I actually have only missed 1 deer lol. I got hit and then ran over by a deer in the city. That makes me even ?  

I always struggled with the quick scope and you can only scope yourself so many times till you give in.  It's been a good boost for my self esteem.  I let my anxiety get myself in a down ward spiral.  I also may have been mis diagnosed with adhd instead of just anxiety. I experienced jealousy for the first time on my life."

keqdz1m,MILeft,2,,1703420335,happy," One book that influenced my exercise habits was published by Mayo Clinic about 20 years ago. It doesn’t seem to be in print any longer. When I googled it, there was a lot of stuff about fidget spinners and burning calories. My takeaway from the book was that moving at least once an hour is a way to keep circulation going. I started keeping small hand weights next to my recliner, and I use them for at least a minute once an hour for 15-18 hours a day. My goal is just to get my heart rate up. I’ve been doing this for years, but now I’m getting credit for it😋
I still do long indoor walks and cardio machines, but as I get older, the fidget method seems to be a way to keep my circulation going and maintaining muscle mass without worrying about it. And the Apple Watch documents my heart rate and other vital statistics, so I am happy with this approach. Good luck to you."

He chose to do it, I never asked and it’s so special to me but if I didn’t I wouldn’t assume it’s bc he didn’t want to. 

Some people would do something you want but you gotta be open and honest on what you’d like"

kef6h3u,EABOD_and_DIAF,2,,1703217421,happy," What a lovely story, and how proud you must feel.  Our children are grown, but still at home, and I'm not sure what significance the holidays hold for them, but I did my best in hopes that they would feel the same awe I did when I looked up from under the tree at the multicolored fairy-lights. While not religious in any way, Christmas was both celebrated and magical when I was a wee eabod_diaf. We had a big family (13 grandkids) and the same routine for the first 40 years of my life. Moms are special, and they are largely the creators of many core memories. I'm rambling because the high/tired convergence is upon me. 

TL;DR: Well done, mum! Beautiful tree, btw."
kef3ie9,milliemallow,4,,1703216020,happy, Thank you and merry Christmas. We’re pretty rich for some folks without a lot of money. 🫶🏼
kehr8ky,milliemallow,1,,1703268463,happy," I feel so proud. They’re the best kids and I want them to be spoiled a little bit when I can swing it. 

I love Christmas and I always have because my mom made it very special for me my whole life and I carry her traditions on. Moms really hold a special key in this season for making it magical. 

Don’t apologize for a ramble. I love a good ramble, especially for a feel good thing. 

Merry Christmas. I hope it’s filled with lots of love and happiness."

Living alone and experiencing just yourself in a bunch of settings is so so so good for you. I’m happy you were able to get to this resolution with your ex, it shows how compassionate and emotionally intelligent you are. 

My ex and I are still best buds because at the end of the day our genuine respect and love for each other trumped whatever resentful feelings that were present. It wasn’t personal, we just weren’t good for each other. I started playing music again after we split up, and I learned a lot about myself."

keomdxr,Fabulous_Maximum_193,1,,1703379975,happy, I’ve had this account for 2 years☠️
ke9urd8,Greymeade,5,,1703127597,happy," It's all in the dough!  That first pizza was made with 00 flour, which is better suited for Neapolitan style pizza (cooked at extremely high temperatures, and resulting in very light and fluffy crust), whereas now I use bread flour, which is better for New York style pizza (cooked at regular oven temperatures, and resulting in a chewier and more ""bready"" crust).  I also became more confident in my dough-handling abilities.  My recipe/process is here, if you're interested! https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/18lpej3/i_finally_did_it_new_yorkstyle/kdz3dkz/"

ke8edys,Cinderellaisdeadnow,2,,1703106391,happy, I would want it as an engagement ring too. When you guys decide you can add a diamond to the promise ring setting. Whatever you do don’t push the marriage issue bec for some men this is huge and scary. So happy for you both he must truly love you. Lovely ring.
ke8i1bm,EternalShoptimist,2,,1703107718,happy," Aww congratulations! It’s beautiful & so sweet he put so much thought into the promise ring, and then obviously also love the sentiment behind him wanting your input on your forever ring❤️ wishing you love & good blessings!"

Not like anyone else's rings unique like me.

ke74rdq,KushQueen0420,2,,1703090055,happy, Thank you so much!!!! He was worried he would get me something I wouldn't like. It turns out he picked the perfect place holder ring till he makes a custom one for me.

I'll wait for him forever if I have to I too love him very much!"
ke8jiyj,KushQueen0420,2,,1703108261,happy," Thank you so much for your words of love and support. We appreciate them so much. He actually was worried I wasn't gonna like it. But it fits me to a T, really. I told him I wanted him to surprise me, that yes I would send him ideas and stuff I like to help him but I want to be surprised cause I think he knows me enough and also has a really good brain for ideas . Plus he's a huge rock nerd like me and I know he will pick the right stones or rocks to put in my forever ring. I'm not a normal person I would take a Quartz crystal in my ring."

ke8u4iu,SeedlessFlamingo,2,,1703112286,happy," Is this supposed to mean “sick”? Like, when something’s gorgeous it’s also sickening"
ke8gssp,CowboyAirman,19,,1703107267,happy," It’s a commitment to a monogamous relationship, but not to marriage."
ke8i84m,KushQueen0420,0,,1703107787,happy, The difference is this is for us and some of our friends to know about. It's for me so I know how much he appreciates me for being by his side through some very dark and hard times and that he's promising he only wants me for the rest of his life but he wants to one day propose in the right way with mine and his families involved like the traditional way of things cause our parents our more traditional then we would like to admit. We do not care about traditions but we care about our families so yeah. It's a promise to an official engagement of being married to each other one day. We appreciate your congrats 😊
kee826a,KushQueen0420,1,,1703202503,happy, Awwwwww thank you sooooo much!!!! I would agree with you 💯! Most definitely I've showed him alot so far and I think we have an idea of the colors for our wedding even though it may be 5yrs from now but oh well. It's fun to plan and brainstorm.
ke7wlat,CrochetTeaBee,3,,1703099990,happy, I'm curious to know what they are and what they represent! Especially if sharing about them allows you to gush and be lovey!!! You deserve dwelling in love and joy! Please share everything you want to!!
ke6tjfj,KushQueen0420,2,,1703085849,happy, We are gonna combine us. So we are gonna have a satanic hippie wedding! Lol he wants an ordained satanic minister marry us and I would like it outside with lots of plants and flowers. I can see the vision just gotta put it on paper and out irl. I'm a major modern hippie and he's very dark and mysterious. The yang to my yin. We are from small towns so most definitely its gonna be a kinda small wedding
ke6zzda,KushQueen0420,2,,1703088285,happy, Yes and no lol its gonna be a looooong engagement till we get our life stuff in order first then wedding. Just so we have the funds for the wedding we want. I love him so much I'll wait for my wedding day with him.
ke7bc3e,KushQueen0420,1,,1703092412,happy, Enjoy away!!!! It's pretty bright and elated right now. My damn cheeks hurt from smiling so much!

ke8iroh,KushQueen0420,2,,1703107987,happy," Oh for sure! Maybe take some from this ring and add it to the other. Something old... and something new, something borrowed just gotta find something blue.... that's how that goes right?"
kebbw09,KushQueen0420,1,,1703161268,happy, That's what I'm wondering?
ke8icy9,KushQueen0420,0,,1703107836,happy, Yesish. It's that and to one day be married.
ke8kfw2,chicagodude84,2,,1703108593,happy," Sounds pretty friggin cool, to be honest! Good for both of you, and congratulations again!! :-)"
kee9o21,chicanaenigma,2,,1703203177,happy," My main advice would be to use this time to lay a strong foundation relationship wise. You already know he’s your love, so a piece of jewelry or big party are minutiae in the grand scheme of things. I hope you’re treated like the queen you are!"
ke80kj1,KushQueen0420,5,,1703101421,happy," He told me he really loved the hidden stones himself he thought it added a nice touch. The heart cause I love hearts and seem to find them anywhere I go, and if I find one, I send it to him. Also, the planty part is cause I'm a BIG OLE' GREEN THUMB GODDESS. He knew from previous jewelry that I've pointed out in the past and that I would love the leaves and stems for the flower as a beautiful detail to an already beautiful ring. He really knows me more than he thought."
ke7s4a8,CrochetTeaBee,3,,1703098383,happy," oh FUCK YEAH I can see lots of pine, red leaves, lots of fire elements throughout the decorations, maybe a fiery dress... I'm so excited for you!!"
ke76w34,Active_Recording_789,2,,1703090821,happy, Sounds like you already have a good start on it!
ke715h5,Clean_Hall4698,2,,1703088721,happy," Definitely take the time you need! Lol, I feel outside pressure can take its toll and it’s your life/wedding that should matter the most! You’re gonna have a great wedding! I can feel it!"
ke892hn,rutgerbadcat,2,,1703104471,happy, Haha Right on !! It's a good day
ke8yonb,belckie,2,,1703114107,happy, That would be so sweet!!! Are blue diamonds a thing? Like pink or yellow?
ke8k9f6,chicagodude84,3,,1703108527,happy," Whoop whoop!! Listen, if you happy, I'm happy! Not that my happiness should affect you at all! Anyhow, toke on, and congratulations again! The ring is beautiful :-)"
ke8kxa3,KushQueen0420,1,,1703108773,happy, Yeah he's for sure the yang to my yin ☯️ we compliment each other pretty well. Thank you again for your positive words and support 😊
keer46t,KushQueen0420,1,,1703210597,happy, I thank you so much and appreciate your advice given. We have agreed to get life in order before we do any wedding stuff or big announcements of our engagement yet. This is just a promise that we will and are each others number one in this life. He definitely treats me like a 👸.
ke72kga,KushQueen0420,1,,1703089249,happy, Oh for sure. We want to get our house stuff in order and make sure we are financially set in the future . Also we would like to get my kids stuff figured out too. Then we will start planning our wedding. We wanna be responsible and also know that we will eventually do it but life stuff is more important then planning a wedding and being super stressed out and having no money to do it.
ke8ikeh,KushQueen0420,1,,1703107911,happy, Damn right it is. Make sure you smile at someone cause they will smile and it will be an infectious positive day for everyone! Spread love and peace
ke8yx9k,KushQueen0420,1,,1703114205,happy, Not sure I just remembered that jingle since I was a kid.
ke8ldfp,KushQueen0420,0,,1703108939,happy, Most definitely happy as happy as a fat kid in a cake and candy store. Thank you again! I'm so in love with it and him and makes me the happiest 💕 ☺️😊 I don't think I've said happy that much in a long time.
ke8v90b,rutgerbadcat,2,,1703112725,happy, Always do miss. Did that for 40 yrs before I retired. And still do. Good to hear some carry it on \~S

kdn06vl,scoutsadie,4,,1702748594,happy," hi friend. if you can see a medical professional to discuss your mood swings, i think that would be best. they can hopefully assess the whole pic of you and your life, and work with you to address any concerns.

and as the other commenter said, everything in life changes, including happiness. what i practice is being mindful of what is - my thoughts, feelings, circumstances - and be present, remembering that everything changes and that i can cultivate gratitude and compassion for myself and others, but that i won't always feel a certain way and that's just what is."
kdm1n4p,Distinct-Asparagus93,3,,1702735162,happy," I am 45 now and still can not find way to be happy all the time :) Just reality is that we can try our best to appreciate the little things in our everyday life. For mood swings can be reason also : not enough nourishing food, hormones, people at home, physical activities, etc."
kdm7et6,PleasantYamm,3,,1702737659,happy, It’s normal to have ups and down in life but if you feel like you’re swinging between extreme happiness and sadness then it might be a good idea to check in with your doctor.
kdm4uq3,TranslatorNice6101,2,,1702736560,happy, Blood sugar can cause ups and downs
kdmsn7d,BCInAlberta,2,,1702745896,happy," It's about context. You need sadness to appreciate when you're happy. I think if you were happy all the time, you would eventually get sad because you were happy all the time. It is the human condition to feel the full range of emotions.  I'd only worry if there were drastic swings in either direction, then you may want to talk to someone about whether you have an imbalance."
kdo9d8w,obelix_asterix,2,,1702764231,happy, You can’t recognize happiness if you haven’t experienced sadness.

Maybe it is loneliness."
kdmx9eh,AdFrosty3860,1,,1702747540,happy, It’s normal. Sometimes people can’t even identify the cause of moods and it can be due to hormones
kea87kp,Muted_Profession_749,1,,1703133948,happy," I feel like some other comments mightve missed the mark a bit. I feel like I can relate to this recently.

I don't think I have depression or anything, but I feel just destitute some times and just purely unhappy. I definitely agree with everyone that you can't be happy all the time, obviously. But like, the way I'm interpreting it is just feeling real sadness for no reason. I don't feel like I've accurately explained it, but idk tell me if I hit or missed

To fix it I definitely think see a therapist, thats what I plan on doing"
